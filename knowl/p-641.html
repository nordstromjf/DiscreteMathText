<div class="para">The picture represents the two premises of the argument. In the Venn diagram we have a circle representing students taking Discrete Math (“Discrete Math”) and a circle representing computer science majors (“CS majors”). The CS major circle is completely inside the Discrete Math circle since the first statement in the argument is that all computer science majors take Discrete Math. This means the set of computer science majors is a subset of the set of students taking Discrete Math. The second statement in the argument is that Anna is a computer science major. This means Anna is an element (represented by a point) of the set of CS majors.</div>

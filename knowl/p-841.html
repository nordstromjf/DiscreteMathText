<div class="para">We've now seen several examples of even/ odd integers. Are there integers which are both even and odd? Can an integer be neither even nor odd? The answer to both questions is no. However, proving that every integer is even or odd (and not both), is pretty challenging, and we won't try to do it, yet. We will use this fact, though, so if we know an integer is not even, then it must be odd, and vice versa.</div>

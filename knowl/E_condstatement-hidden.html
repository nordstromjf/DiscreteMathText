<body class="ignore-math"><article class="example example-like"> <div class="para">Suppose I say to you “If it rains tomorrow, then class is cancelled.” When would you accuse me of lying to you? For example, if it doesn't rain and we have class, would you have thought my statement false? No. Now, you might not think my statement is true, either. But remember, statements must be either true or false. So if it is not false, then it is true.</div> <div class="para">Now, what if it doesn't rain, but I cancel class anyway? Would I have lied? No, I didn't tell you I wouldn't cancel class. So, again, this would be a true statement.</div> <div class="para">The only time you could accuse me of having made a false statement is if it rains and we don't cancel class. If we think of “it rains tomorrow” as <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> and “class is cancelled” as <span class="process-math">\(q\text{,}\)</span> then the only time the statement is false is when <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> is true and <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span> is false.</div></article></body>

<div class="para">To determine if a given number is rational, we need to be able to find a way to write it as a fraction of integers. To prove a number is rational is really a type of existence proof--we need to show <span class="process-math">\(a, b\in \mathbb{Z}\)</span> exist. To prove a number is not rational, we need to show there is no possible way to write it as a fraction of integers. Also, keep in mind that rational and irrational numbers first need to be real numbers. It is possible that a number that is not rational is not a real number, and thus, not irrational either.</div>

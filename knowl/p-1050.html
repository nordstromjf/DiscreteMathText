<a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/T_FTofArith.html" title="Theorem 4.3.6: Unique Factorization Theorem">TheoremÂ 4.3.6</a> is more powerful than it may seem. Although you have probably found prime factorizations before, you may not have thought much about the fact that they are unique. Consider the statement <span class="process-math">\(3\mid 2^{101}\text{.}\)</span> Is this true or false? Well, since <span class="process-math">\(2^{101}\)</span> is a prime factorization, the only prime divisor it has is 2. Thus, <span class="process-math">\(3\mid 2^{101}\)</span> is false. If you have the prime factorization of an integer, then you know exactly which primes (and which powers of primes) divide the integer.</div>

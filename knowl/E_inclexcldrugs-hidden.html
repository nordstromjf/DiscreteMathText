<div class="para">Suppose a study was done with three drugs, A, B and C. A total of 50 subjects used all three drugs. They reported which drugs made them feel better, with the following results:</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">21 felt better with A</div></li>
<li><div class="para">21 felt better with B</div></li>
<li><div class="para">31 felt better with C</div></li>
<li><div class="para">9 felt better with A and B</div></li>
<li><div class="para">14 felt better with A and C</div></li>
<li><div class="para">15 felt better with B and C</div></li>
<li><div class="para">41 felt better with at least one drug</div></li>
</ul>
<div class="para">Some of the subjects who had relief from, say, A, might also have had relief from another drug. So some of the 21 who reported feeling better with A, may also be included in the count of the 9 who felt better with A and B.</div>
</div> <div class="para">How many had relief from none of the drugs?</div> <a href="" class="answer-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/answer-387-hidden.html" title="Answer 9.3.4.1"><span class="type">Answer</span><span class="space"> </span><span class="codenumber">1</span><span class="period">.</span></a> <div class="para">How many had relief from all three of the drugs?</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">We need to calculate <span class="process-math">\(N(A\cap B\cap C)\text{,}\)</span> which we can find by rewriting the Inclusion-Exclusion Rule:</div>

\begin{align*}

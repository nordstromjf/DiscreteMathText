<div class="para">In <a href="rstrelations8-2.html" class="internal" title="Section 8.2: Reflexive, Symmetric, Transitive Properties">Section 8.2</a> we studied three properties of a relation, the reflexive, symmetric, and transitive properties. These three properties are important for generalizing the idea of equality in mathematics. We may want to relate objects based on certain criteria; objects that share that criteria are “equivalent.” For example, you may recall from geometry, the idea of congruent triangles. Two triangles are congruent if they have the same angles. In geometry, we may not care at all about the lengths of the sides, just the angles. In this case, we relate triangles with the same angles and treat them as the same triangle.</div>

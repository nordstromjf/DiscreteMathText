<div class="para">The origin story for this section is the Konigsberg Bridge Problem, which involves seven bridges, as pictured in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F_Kbridge.html" title="Figure 10.2.1">FigureÂ 10.2.1</a>. The story is that the challenge of Konigsberg was to try to traverse all the bridges, without repeating one, and return to where you started. Euler found a way to represent the problem as a graph, also pictured. The vertices are the land masses and the edges are the bridges. This representation makes it easier to try to answer the question. Before moving on, try to solve the bridge problem by finding a route through the graph that starts and ends at some vertex and traverses each edge exactly once.</div>

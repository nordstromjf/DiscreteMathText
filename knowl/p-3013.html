<div class="para">A college conducted a survey to explore the academic interests and achievements of its students. It asked students to place checks beside the numbers of all statements that were true of them. Statement #1 was “I was on the honor roll last term.” Statement #2 was “I belong to an academic club.” Statement #3 was “I am majoring in at least two subjects.” Out of a sample of 100 students, 28 checked #1, 26 checked #2, and 14 checked #3, 18 checked both #1 and #2, 4 checked both #1 and #3, 3 checked both #2 and #3, and 2 checked all three. Note that some of the students who checked #1 (or #2 or #3) may have also checked other numbers.</div>

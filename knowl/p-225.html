<div class="para">The truth values for an “or” statement should, mostly, make sense,  as long as one part of the “or” statement is true, the whole statement is true. You may ask about the case where both parts are true. We think of this as an “inclusive or,” which means we allow both to be true. For example, “A computer science major must take Math 175 or Math 250.” You will still get a major if you take both. There is a connective for an “exclusive or” (one or the other, not both), but we won't use it in this course.</div>

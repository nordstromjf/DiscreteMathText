<div class="para">For the case with three sets, we can see that each element in the intersection of at least two sets got counted twice, but when we subtract off all three intersections, we end up subtracting each element in more than one intersection twice, so we need to add back the elements in the intersection of all three sets. For this class, we won't need to use Inclusion-Exclusion on more than three sets, but the rule does generalize to <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> sets by adding the sets, subtracting intersections of two sets, adding the intersections of three sets, subtracting the intersections of four sets, etc.</div>

<li><div class="para">You will likely need to do scratchwork. Do not include the scratchwork in your actual proof.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The point of the proof is that the reader can follow all of the steps. You do not need to explain where your choices came from. For example, in the proof in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/E_divisinduction1.html" title="Example 5.3.1: Proof by Induction: Divisibility">ExampleÂ 5.3.1</a>, it might not be obvious why you should add <span class="process-math">\(3k^2+3k\text{,}\)</span> but the reader just needs to know that 3 divides the expression, which is clear.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Divisibility proofs in this form can be challenging to do at first, but with practice, they often end up being some of the easier induction proofs to do, as they all follow a similar format.</div></li>

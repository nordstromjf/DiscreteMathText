<div class="para">In order to calculate a probability, we need to be able to count <dfn class="terminology">equally-likely</dfn> events. Just because there are, say, 3 outcomes, that doesn't mean all the outcomes are equally-likely. For example, the Linfied football team could win, lose, or tie a game. Given the team's winning streak, the three outcomes are not equally-likely. They have a much higher probability of winning than just 1/3.</div>

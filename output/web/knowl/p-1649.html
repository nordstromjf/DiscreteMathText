<div class="para">The Fibonacci sequence is a good example of a recursively defined sequence where it is difficult to find an explicit formula. An explicit formula for the Fibonacci sequence does exist, we will see it in the next section and in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/EC_Fibexplicit.html" title="Exercise 5.5.7">ExerciseÂ 5.5.7</a>, but it requires much more sophisticated mathematics to find it than anything we will see in this course. If you are interested, though, this is the sort of thing you would see if you take a combinatorics course. When we do see the formula, it should be clear that it is computationally <em class="emphasis">much</em> harder to work with than the recursive definiton (which is why you rarely see it when working with the Fibonacci sequence).</div>

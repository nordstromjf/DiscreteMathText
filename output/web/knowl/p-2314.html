<div class="para">We use modular arithmetic and equivalence mod <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> when we want to think about remainders when dividing by <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> A familiar example is clock time. Suppose it is 11 am and you have an appointment in 3 hours. In general, you would not think of your appointment for 14 o'clock. You would think of noon as 0, and get that your appointment is at 2 o'clock. There are many more applications in algebra, cryptography, and computer science where we want to classify integers by their remainders mod <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span>

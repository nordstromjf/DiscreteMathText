<div class="para">We want to be able to expand our ability to use logic with mathematical statements. Many mathematical statements use variables. We say that an expression such as <span class="process-math">\(x+y=5\)</span> is not a statement. However, if we can give more information about <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span> then we can use such an expression in a statement. For example, we could say there exists an <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(x+y=5\text{.}\)</span> Or we could say for every <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> there exists a <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(x+y=5\text{.}\)</span> To use statements with “for every” and “there exists,” we will need to be able to understand logical statements with quantifiers.</div>

<div class="para">Now we apply induction to statements involving inequalities. These will be some of the most challenging induction proofs as they often take a bit more trial and error in the scratchwork. When dealing with <em class="emphasis">equalities</em>, you know that you have to add the same thing to both sides. However, with <em class="emphasis">inequalities</em> you can change one side as long as you maintain the inequality. For example, if you know <span class="process-math">\(P&gt;Q\text{,}\)</span> then you also know <span class="process-math">\(P+2&gt;Q\text{.}\)</span> The fact that we can change one side of the expression makes it more challenging to see what steps to take.</div>

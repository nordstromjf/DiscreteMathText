  "title": "Variables and Statements",
  "body": " Variables and Statements  Think of some examples of variables variable you've seen in other math classes. What do these variables represent? Probably, the first example that comes to mind is something from an algebra class, such as or . You may also think of examples such as solving for in an expression such as . We use variables in mathematical statements to represent quantities that can vary. But we also use them to be more precise. Think of how much more confusing would be if we had to write it as \"a number squared equals another number;\" or , \"the function which multiplies a number by 3 and adds 2.\" When you first learned varables, you probably were introduced to them in terms of sentences, but eventually, you got used to what the symbols mean.  In this class, we will rarely be interested in mathematical equations. We want to move to the common format of mathematical statements often found when describing mathematical defintions or theorems.  Common forms of mathematical statements:  Universal Statements universal statement  We use these statements when a property is true for all things in a set.  Example: Every math student takes Calculus.   Conditional Statements conditional statement  These statements usually have the form \"if...then...\".  Example: If a student majors in Computer Science, then she takes Discrete Math.  Existential Statements existential statement  We use these statements when somthing exists with a particular property.  Example: There exists a Linfield class that meets at 9am on Mondays.      Give an additional example of each type of statement.     For each of the following statements, determine which type of statement it is, universal, conditional, or existential.  All even numbers have a factor of 2.  If , then .  There exists a number greater than 100.    There is a relationship between universal statements and conditional statements.  Rewrite the statement All even numbers have a factor of 2. as a conditional statement.  Rewrite the statement If , then . as a universal statement.   We can also combine statements of the above types. Many mathematical statements are combinations of the common forms.  Universal Conditional universal conditional  For all ___, if ___ then ___.  Example: For every real number , if , then .  Universal Existential universal existential  For all ___, there exists ___.  Example: For all integers , there exists an integer such that .  Existential Universal existential universal  There exists ___ for every ___.  Example: There exists an integer such that for all integers , .   Give an additional example of each of the combined forms.  One thing that makes understanding mathematical statements tricky is that they can be phrased in different ways. Try writing one of your statements from in two different (but equivalent) ways. You might think about how you would express the same idea in a less formal way. If your statement involves variables, can you write it without them? If your statement does not include variables, can you write it with some?   Check Your Understanding  Consider the statement \"If it is Tuesday, then we will have pizza for lunch.\" Which type of statement is this?   Universal    Conditional    Existential   Conditional  Consider the statement \"If it is Tuesday, then we will have pizza for lunch.\" Rewrite this statement as a universal statement. Every Tuesday we will have pizza for lunch.  Consider the statement \"Every differentiable function is continuous.\" Which type of statement is this?   Universal    Conditional    Existential   Universal  Consider the statement \"Every differentiable function is continuous.\" Rewrite this statement as a conditional statement. If a function is differentiable, then it is continuous.    Exercises  Often it is necessary to convert an informal mathematical statement into a more formal one. Complete the following statements so they are equivalent to The reciprocal of any positive number is positive.   Given any positive real number , the reciprocal of ___.  For any real number , if is ___ then ___.  If a real number ___, then ___.    Complete the following statements so they are equivalent to The cube root of any negative real number is negative.

In order to better understand mathematical statements, it can be helpful to write statements less formally. First rewrite each statement without using variables, then determine whether the statements are true or false.   There are real numbers and with the property that .

  "title": "Introduction to Sets",
  "body": " Introduction to Sets  Sets set are collections of objects. They may be collections of mathematical objects, such as numbers or functions. They may be collections of any other type of object such as students in a class or times of day. We can even have sets of sets!  We will usually use capital letters for sets, such as or . If we want to talk about elements in a set , we use the notation is an element of . We read this notatation as is in or is an element of . If is not in , then we use the notation is not an element of .  If we want to list the specific elements of a set, we use curly brackets, , around the elements of the set. We can also do this with a description of the elements in the set.   Set roster notation set roster notation  . This is the set whose elements are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.  . This describes the odd numbers in , so 1, 3, 5.  . This describes the real numbers between 1 and 5 (which there are too many to list).   In general, if we use to describe a property of , we use the notation and read the statement as in such that has property . in such that has property  Let . List the elements in each of the following sets.       A subset subset , , of a set is a set of elements that are also in . We use the notation . is a subset of   If is not a subset of , then we use the notation is not a subset of . Note, some books use as the notation for subset.   Subset Notation  We can see that since every element of is also in . However, since .   It is important to understand the difference between subset, , and element, . For example, if , then , but . This is because 1 is an element, not a set. Similarly, , but . This is because is a set, not an element. In general, when working with sets, you should identify the elements of the set. Then sets of those elements are subsets. The curly brackets are our way of saying set.  The distinction between elements and sets really gets fuzzy when we want to think about sets of sets.   Example of a set with elements that are sets sets of sets  Let  The six elements are The following are examples of elements and subsets. In each of the examples, pay close attention to how the brackets are being used.         It will also be useful to look at examples that are not elements or subsets.   , 3 is not one of the six elements.  , is not one of the six elements.  , is not one of the six elements.  , 1 is not a set.  , since 4 is not an element, is not a subset.  , since is not an element, is not a subset.  , since is not an element, is not a subset.   In each of the nonexamples of elements, the object listed is not one of the six elements. In each of the nonexamples of subsets, the set is not a set of elements.    Determine if each of the following is true or false. If it is false, what small change in notation would make it true? Make sure you are able to distinguish between elements of a set and subsets of a set.        When you have a set with elements that are sets you need to be really careful about the notation. For example, let . In this set, two of the elements are sets . Determine if the following are true or false for the set .         Three of the statements are false.    If and , then we say is a proper  proper subset subset proper subset of .  There are some special subsets that we will use throughout the course and, in fact, the rest of your mathematical career.   Notation for special sets of numbers  the set of real numbers , the set of real numbers real number . These are all the numbers your are familiar with from Calculus: whole numbers, positives, negatives, fractions, decimals, square roots, , , etc.  the set of integers , the set integers integer . These are all the whole numbers: positive, negative, and zero.  the set of rational numbers , the set rational numbers rational number . These are all the whole numbers and fractions: positive, negative, and zero. We will revisit this set in more detail later.  the set of natural numbers , the set of natural numbers natural number . These are all the positive whole numbers. Some books include zero, some do not. Since this can be confusing, we will avoid this notation in this class (but you might see it in future classes). Instead, we will use one of the next two notations, which more clearly denote inclusion of zero, or not.  the set of positive integers , the set of positive integers. These are all the positive whole numbers. This set does NOT include zero.  the set of nonnegative integers , the set of nonnegative integers. These are the whole numbers that are not negative. This set DOES include zero.  the set of positive real numbers , the set of positive real numbers.  the set of nonnegative real numbers , the set of nonnegative real numbers. These are the real numbers that are not negative.   Based on the notations above, what would be a good notation for the set of integers less than zero?  Which of the following sets do NOT contain zero: ?  We now define a new set.   The Cartesian product product of sets Cartesian product of two sets and is the set of ordered pairs, where the first coordinate comes from set and the second coordinate comes from set . We use the notation  the product of and ;   Cartesian Product of Sets Let . Then .  Cartesian Product of the Real Numbers When plotting points in a plane, you use the Cartesian product .

  "title": "Introduction to Relations and Functions",
  "body": " Introduction to Relations and Functions  We are familiar with the idea of a function from previous math courses. In this class we want to understand functions as an important mathematical tool to relate objects to each other. We are used to functions from the real numbers to the real numbers in calculus. All math courses use functions in some way, often relating other mathematical objects, such as vectors in vector calculus, matrices in linear algebra, complex numbers in complex analysis, or strings of characters in computer science.  A function really describes a relationship, so we will start with the more general mathematical concept of a relation.   A relation relation , , from a set to a set is a subset of .  We can describe a relation as a subset, or in the form is related to , which means is related to .   It is important to note that a relation is just a set. As long as the first coordinate comes from and the second from , we have a relation. The notation is a convenient way to describe whether two elements are related. In this case, we are thinking of as a symbol representing the relationship, rather than as a set.  Example of a relation  Let . Let . Then is a subset of . Thus, it is a relation.  Since , is true.  Since , is false. Note, since consists of ordered pairs, the order matters.   A Familiar Relation  There are lots of familiar relations in math. For example, is a relation.  Let . Find from to if  is given by .    If is a relation from to , then is the domain  domain relation relation domain of the relation, and is the codomain codomain relation relation codomain of the relation.  An arrow diagram for a relation is a picture of the two sets with an arrow from to if .   Arrow diagram for the relation .      A function function , , from a set to a set , , is a mapping such that for every there is a unique with .  Example of a function  Let . Let . Then . We can check that it is a function: if we choose an , we can see that there is a corresponding real number , which always exists. We can also see that for any , there is only one possible number as output.   A function is really a relation with some additional properties. First, for each in , a corresponding must exist. Second, must be unique. In other words, every must map somewhere and each can only map to one .  Since a function is a relation, we can use relation notation to represent a function. Often we use for the relation. In particular, if and only if .  Example of a function as a relation  Let . Let . Then is a subset of , thus it is a relation. Give 3 examples of ordered pairs in .  There are lots of examples, are a few.   Example of an equation as a relation  Let . Let if and only if . Then is a subset of , thus it is a relation. Give 3 examples of ordered pairs in .

  "title": "Truth-Tables and Logical Equivalence",
  "body": " Truth-Tables and Logical Equivalence  We want to understand what makes a mathematical proof. One of the foundations for proofs is logical structure. If we build a good foundation in logic, then we can better understand mathematical statements and proof structures. So we begin by looking at logical forms, independent of content.  A logical argument logical argument consists of premises and a conclusion. The premises and conclusion are statements. A statement logical statement is a sentence that is either true of false (not both!).  Statements   is a statement. It is a true statement.  is a statement. It is a false statement.  is not a statement. It is neither true nor false. If we had additional information, such as specific information about the variables, then this might be a statement.  I ate breakfast today. is a statement. Although you might not be able to determine whether I ate breakfast, the statement is either true or false.    If and are variables representing statements, we can combine these statements into new statements using logical connectives.   Logical Connectives: NOT, AND, OR   Negation connective negation NOT. Notation: not , read as not .   Conjunction connective conjunction AND. Notation: and , read as and .   Disjunction connective disjunction OR. Notation: or , read as or .     Our goal is to determine when these new statements are true or false based on whether and are true or false. We can create a truth-table truth-table that looks at all the possibilities of true of false for and . When writing a truth-table, make a column for each variable, list all the possible cases of true and false, then for each case, determine whether the new statement (with the connective) is true or false.   Truth-table for .          T  F    F  T     It should make sense that if we negate T we get F, and vice versa.   Truth-table for .            T  T  T    T  F  F    F  T  F    F  F  F     Again, the truth values for an and statement should make sense. The only time it should be true is if both parts of the statement are true.   Truth-table for .            T  T  T    T  F  T    F  T  T    F  F  F     The truth values for an or statement should, mostly, make sense, as long as one part of the or statement is true, the whole statement is true. You may ask about the case where both parts are true. We think of this as an inclusive or, which means we allow both to be true. For example, A computer science major must take Math 175 or Math 250. You will still get a major if you take both. There is a connective for an exclusive or (one or the other, not both), but we won't use it in this course.  Now that we can connect two statements, we can connect as many as we'd like using multiple quantifiers. For example, we could form the statement . Make sure you use parentheses when combining statements. For example, is not the same as .   Truth-table for and .                  T  T  F  T  T  F    T  F  F  F  T  F    F  T  T  T  T  F    F  F  T  T  F  T     Give the truth-table for .  Give the truth-table for .  truth-tables can have more than two variables. We just need to make sure we have a row for every possible combination of truth values for the variables. How many rows will you need in a truth-table for 3 variables? Give the truth-table for .  One of the things we want to be able to do is to translate English (or mathematical) sentences into logical statements. We have to be careful about how common phrases are really hidden and s. For example, but is really . Similarly, neither nor is really .  A tautology tautology is a statement that is always true.  For example, is a tautology. If you check the truth-table, you will see that the only values in the column for the statement are T.  A contradiction contradiction is a statement that is always false.  For example, is a contradiction. If you check the truth-table, you will see that the only values in the column for the statement are F.  Note that tautologies and contradictions are logical statements that are always true or always false, independent of the content of .  If we want to make bigger statements using tautologies or contradictions, we can use a statement that is always true; tautology to represent a tautology and a statement that is always false; contradiction to represent a contradiction. For example, we could find the truth-table for .  Example of   Truth-table for .            T  T  T    F  T  F       Two statements are logically equivalent logical equivalence if they have identical truth-tables. If statements and are logically equivalent, we denote it is logically equivalent to .  For example, we can see that is logically equivalent to by comparing the first and last columns of .  Use a truth-table to determine if and are logically equivalent. What does this tell you about distributing negation?  Use a truth-table to show and are logically equivalent.  Use a truth-table to show and are logically equivalent.  The equivalences in and are called DeMorgan's Laws DeMorgan's Laws . These are useful equivalences and are worth committing to memory. As we've seen in the above activities, we cannot simply distribute a negation sign. However, DeMorgan's Laws allow us to distribute the negation as long as we also change from and to or and vice versa. Given the importance of this concept in mathematics, it is useful at this point to convince yourself that the negation of and and statement is an or statement and vice versa using statements in English. For example, if the weather is not cold and rainy, then it is either not cold or not rainy.  One thing to be careful about with English statements is that they do not naturally contain parentheses, we often really have to think about the meaning of the statement and infer the intended parentheses. Even in the above cold and rainy sentence, we have to understand that we mean not (cold and rainy) rather than (not cold) and rainy.  The following is a list of important logical equivalences. All of them can be checked using truth-tables.   Summary of Logical Equivalences logical equivalence  Let and be variables representing statements. Let be a tautology and be a contradiction.

Before looking at the truth-table, we need to understand when an if...then... statement is true or false. This is actually trickier than it seems.  Conditional Statement  Suppose I say to you If it rains tomorrow, then class is cancelled. When would you accuse me of lying to you? For example, if it doesn't rain and we have class, would you have thought my statement false? No. Now, you might not think my statement is true, either. But remember, statements must be either true or false. So if it is not false, then it is true.  Now, what if it doesn't rain, but I cancel class anyway? Would I have lied? No, I didn't tell you I wouldn't cancel class. So, again, this would be a true statement.  The only time you could accuse me of having made a false statement is if it rains and we don't cancel class. If we think of it rains tomorrow as and class is cancelled as , then the only time the statement is false is when is true and is false.    Truth-table for .

A Mathematical Conditional Statement  Consider the mathematical statement If then . Do you agree this is a true mathematical statement?  Let be and be . Consider all the cases of and being true or false.  For example, if , then we have the case where is true and is true.  If , then we have the case where is false and is true. But remember, the original statement is still true!  If , then we have the case where is false and is false. But again, the original statement is still true.  It will be impossible to find an that makes true and false. Thus, we never have the case where the conditional is false.   Give an example of a conditional statement, not one of the examples from above. Write in your own words why must be true whenever is false.  In a conditional statement , we call the hypothesis , and the conclusion .  Use a truth-table to show is logically equivalent to . This is the rule for negating an if...then.

  "title": "Valid and Invalid Arguments",
  "body": " Valid and Invalid Arguments argument  We've been looking at logical statements, and now we want to be able to put statements together to form logical arguments. Just like with the statements, we are going to be concerned more about the structure of an argument than the specific content.  An argument consists of premises and a conclusion. You must have at least one premise, but can have as many as you like. You have exactly one conclusion.   General Form of an Argument argument   A  B  C  Statements A and B are the premises premise , and statement C is the conclusion conclusion . The symbol therefore is read therefore.    Since an argument is just a list of statements, we need some structure for what makes a good argument.  An argument is valid valid argument if whenever the premises are true, the conclusion must be true.  An argument is invalid invalid argument if it is possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false.  It is really important to note that validity of an argument does not depend on the actual truth or falsity of the statements. To decide if an argument is valid, we construct a truth-table for the premises and conclusion. Then we check for whether there is a case where the premises are true and the conclusion false.  Valid Argument Decide whether the following argument is valid or invalid.    We construct a truth-table with a columnn for each premise and conclusion.               T  T  T  T    T  F  F  T    F  T  F  F    F  F  F  F     Since we are looking for where the premise is true, we only need to look at the first row (in bold). In this case, the conclusion is also true. Thus, whenever to premises are true the conclusion must be true. Hence, the argument is valid.   Invalid Argument Decide whether the following argument is valid or invalid.    We construct a truth-table with a columnn for each premise and conclusion.               T  T  T  T    T  F  T  T    F  T  T  F    F  F  F  F     The first three rows all have true premises. However, in the case that is false and is true, the premise is true while the conclusion is false. Thus, it is possible to have true premises and a false conclusion. Hence, the argument is invalid.   Use a truth-table to determine if the following argument is valid or invalid.       Use a truth-table to determine if the following argument is valid or invalid.       Use a truth-table to determine if the following argument is valid or invalid.        An Argument with False Premises and False Conclusion  Let's look at a more specific example:   The sun is purple and the sun sets in the west.  Therefore, the sun is purple.   Although the two statements are false, the argument is still valid. It has the form of , which we determined was valid. But if we think about the definition of validity, we should be able to see that it would be impossible to have the premise be true while the conclusion is false.   If possible, give an example of an argument (in sentences, not variables) that meets the given criteria. If it is not possible, just state that it is not possible.  A valid argument that has false premises and a true conclusion.  An invalid argument that has false premises and a true conclusion.  A valid argument that has true premises and a true conclusion.  An invalid argument that has true premises and a true conclusion.  A valid argument that has true premises and a false conclusion.  An invalid argument that has true premises and a false conclusion.    Some Common Forms for Valid Arguments  Modus ponens: modus ponens        Modus tollens: modus tollens        Transitivity: transitive argument         Validity of Transitivity We will show that transitivity is a valid argument using a truth-table.  Truth-table for transitivity.                  T  T  T  T  T  T    T  T  F  T  F  F    T  F  T  F  T  T    T  F  F  F  T  F    F  T  T  T  T  T    F  T  F  T  F  T    F  F  T  T  T  T    F  F  F  T  T  T     Looking at the rows where both premises are true (in bold), we can see that the conclusion must be true. Thus, the argument is valid.    Some Common Invalid Arguments  Converse error: converse error        Inverse error: inverse error         Since it is possible to have a valid argument with a false conclusion, but we'd like our arguments to have true conclusions, we need something more to have a good argument.   An argument is sound if it is valid and all the premises are true.   Since a valid argument cannot have true premises and a false conclusion, if the premises are actually true, then the argument must have a true conclusion. Note, soundness of an argument does depend on the actual content of the statements.  Which or your arguments in are sound?   Check Your Understanding  The following is the truth-table for an argument with converse error.                T  T  T  T  T    T  F  F  F  T    F  T  T  T  F    F  F  T  F  F    Which row of the truth-table shows us the argument is invalid?   Row 1  To be invalid, you do want to look for true premises, but what should the conclusion be?    Row 2  To be invalid, you want to look for true premises.    Row 3  In the third row we have true premises and a false conclusion, thus the argument is invalid.    Row 4  To be invalid, you want to look for true premises.                  T  T  T  T  T    T  F  F  F  T    F  T  T  T  F    F  F  T  F  F    We can see in the third row we have true premises and a false conclusion. Thus it is invalid.  Use a truth-table to determine if the following argument is valid or invalid.       The argument is valid.  The third row of the truth-table is the only one with all true premises. In this case the conclusion is true. Thus it is valid.  The argument is invalid.  In the truth-table is it possible to have all the premises be true while the conclusion is false?  I am unable to determine if the argument is valid or invalid.  In the truth-table look for all rows in which all the premises are true. Is is possible to have a false conclusion (invalid), or must the conclusion be true (valid)?                 T  T  T  F  T    T  F  T  F  F    F  T  T  T  T    F  F  F  T  F    The third row is the only one with all true premises. In this case the conclusion is true. Thus it is valid.  True or False: A valid argument can have false premises and a true conclusion. True  True or False: An invalid argument can have true premises and a true conclusion. True  True or False: A valid argument can have true premises and a false conclusion. False  True or False: A sound argument can have false premises and a true conclusion. False  True or False: A sound argument can have true premises and a false conclusion. False    Exercises   Use a truth-table to determine if the following argument is valid or invalid. Indicate the premises and conclusion on your table. Clearly state your conclusion and explain how your truth-table supports your conclusion.

  "body": " Quantifiers quantifier  We want to be able to use variables in statements. For example, is not a statement since it has no truth value. However, if we say, there exists such that or for all , , and we know what set belongs to, then we can decide whether these statements are true or false.   The domain domain for a quantified statement for a quantified statement is the set of possible values for a variable in a quantified statement.  In order to determine whether a statement is true of false, we first need to know the domain.  Domain and Existential Statements  Let . Determine whether the statement there exists such that is true or false.  Since is the only value satisfying the equation, but , the statement is false.  Let . Determine whether the statement there exists such that is true or false.  Since is the only value satisfying the equation, and , the statement is true.  Let . Determine whether the statement there exists such that is true or false.  Since is the only value satisfying the equation, and , the statement is true.   Domain and Universal Statements  Let . Determine whether the statement for all , is true or false.  Since is the only value satisfying the equation, certainly every integer does not satisfy the equation. The statement is false.  Let . Determine whether the statement for all , is true or false.  Since is the only value satisfying the equation, certainly every real number does not satisfy the equation. The statement is false.  Let . Determine whether the statement for all , is true or false.  Since satisfies the equation, and is the only value in , the statement is true.   We want to be able to work with generic statements, like and , but also with variables. Instead of we will use . An expression, , represents some property or expression about . We call the predicate predicate .  In our above examples, is .  Our properties don't just need to be mathematical, though. For example we could have a predicate such as is is a math major. In this case our domain could be the set of students at Linfield or the set of students in Discrete Math.  One goal with quantified statements is to be able to for which values in the domain they are true.   The truth set truth set for a predicate for a predicate, , is the set of values for that make true.  Finding Truth Sets  Find the truth set for given by .  Since is the only value satisfying the equation, the tuth set is .  Find the truth set for given by is even.  The truth set is the set of all even numbers.

Existential quantifier existential quantifier quantifier existential  there exists; existential quantifier , read as there exists or for some.      A universal statement statement universal has the form .  To show a universal statement is true , you need to show all values in make true. If your set is small, you can do this just by showing is true for each (method of exhaustion). If is infinite, however, we will need more general techniques.  To show a universal statement is false , you just need to find one value in which makes false (counterexample).  Let . Show the following statement is true: .  Let . Show the following statement is false: .  An existential statement statement existential has the form .  To show an existential statement is true , you just need to find one value in which makes true.  To show an existential statement is false , you need to show all values in make false, or no values make it true. If your set is small, you can do this just by showing is false for each .

  "body": " Negating Quantified Statements quantifier negation  In this section we will look at how to negate statements involving quantifiers.  If you look back at the Check your Understanding questions in , you should notice that both and were false, which means they are not negations of each other. Similarly, both and were true. In general, the two statements won't necessarily have the same truth values, but the examples were chosen to make sure we can see that they are not negations of each other.   Negating Quantified Statements quantifier negation  The negation of is .  In notation:  The negation of is .  In notation:   We can think of negation as switching the quantifier and negating , but it will be really helpful if we can understand why this is the negation. Thinking about negating a for all statement, we need the statement to not be true for all things, which means it must be false for something, Thus, there exists something making true. Thinking about negating a there exists statement, we need there not to exist anything making true, which means must be false for everything. Thus, everything makes true.  Negating a Quantified Statement  Negate the statement: For all primes , is odd. Is this statement true or false?  There exist a prime such that is not odd. The original statement is false, since we can find an even prime ( ).  Negate the statement: There exists a real number , such that . Is this statement true or false?  For all real numbers , . The original statement is false, since the negation is true.   Write the negation of the following statements (in English).  For all integers , is an integer.  There exists an integer , such that .   Many of our quantified statements may have predicates involving other logical connectives. So it is going to be important to remember how to negate \"and\"s, \"or\"s, and \"if...then\"s. The following summarizes the rules we have already seen for negating statements with connectives   Negations of Logical Statements negation logical statement   AND statement  . This is DeMorgan's Law.  OR statement  . This is DeMorgan's Law.  IF...THEN statement  . The negation of a conditional is NOT a conditional.  Universal conditional     Write the negation of the following statements (in English).  There exists an integer , such that .  For all real numbers , if then .  For all functions , if is continuous, then is differentiable.   Recall from the contapositive of is . We can use this to define the contrapositive of a universal conditional statement.   The universal conditional statement has contrapositive contrapositive universal conditional universal conditional contrapositive  .  Similarly, the converse of is .   The universal conditional statement has converse converse universal conditional universal conditional converse  .  Consider the statement For all real numbers , if then or .  Write the negation of the statement.  Write the contrapositive of the statement.   Consider the statement For all integers , if has a factor of 15, then has a factor of 3 and has a factor of 5.  Write the negation of the statement.  Write the contrapositive of the statement.   The relationship between for all and there exists can be used to show some surprising things. What happens if our domain, , has nothing in it? In particular, let , the empty set. Is true or false? Well, let's look at the negation: . Now the negation must be false since has nothing in it, so there can't exist something in making true. Since the negation is false, the original statement is true! We say is vacuously true. statement vacuously true vacuously true   Vacuously True Statement  Consider the statement For all llamas, , in Discrete Math, is getting an A. The negation is There exists a llama, , in Discrete Math, such that is not getting an A. Since no such llama exists, the negation is false. Making the original true. So every llama in Discrete is getting an A.   As one additional note, it can be helpful in deciding if your negation is correct by finding the truth value of both the original and the negation. They should have opposite values. Similarly, if you need to determine the truth value of a complex statement, it might be easier to find the truth value of the negation.  Determine if each of the following statements are true or false. It may be helpful to look at the negations you founds in the above activities, , , , and .  For all integers , is an integer.  There exists an integer , such that .  There exists an integer , such that .  For all real numbers , if then .  For all functions , if is continuous, then is differentiable.

  "title": "Arguments with Quantifiers",
  "body": " Arguments with Quantifiers argument quantifier  In we studied arguments with logical statements. In this chapter we've looked at statements with quantifiers. Now we want to combine the two ideas.  Recall, an argument is valid argument quantifier valid argument if it whenever the premises are true, the conclusion must be true. An argument is invalid invalid argument if it possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false.  An Argument with Quantified Statements    All computer science majors take Discrete Math before graduation.  Anna is a computer science major.  Anna takes Discrete Math before graduation.  Is this argument valid or invalid?  This argument is valid.   Another Argument with Quantified Statements    All computer science majors take Discrete Math before graduation.  Troy did not take Discrete Math before graduation.  Troy is not a computer science major.  Is this argument valid or invalid?  This argument is valid.   Although and are a valid arguments, we will have trouble using a truth-table to determine validity. In this section we will develop other tools for analyzing quantified arguments. These examples are extentions of modus ponens and modus tollens from .   Common Forms of Arguments with Quantifiers  Universal modus ponens modus ponens universal :  , if then     is an example of universal modus ponens.  Universal modus tollens modus tollens universal :  , if then     is an example of universal modus tollens.   To determine validity of quantified arguments we need to ask if it is possible for the premises to be true while the conclusion is false. If it is possible, then the argument is invalid. If it is not possible, then the argument is valid. We will use Venn diagrams Venn diagram quantified argument to help us determine validity. A Venn diagram is just a picture where we use circles to represent sets of objects and points to represent specific elements. We draw the circles to represent how our sets are related to each other.  The Venn diagram for is given by the following figure.   Venn diagram for the argument in     The picture represents the two premises of the argument. In the Venn diagram we have a circle representing students taking Discrete Math ( Discrete Math ) and a circle representing computer science majors ( CS majors ). The CS major circle is completely inside the Discrete Math circle since the first statement in the argument is that all computer science majors take Discrete Math. This means the set of computer science majors is a subset of the set of students taking Discrete Math. The second statement in the argument is that Anna is a computer science major. This means Anna is an element (represented by a point) of the set of CS majors.  Now, if we look at the diagram determined by the two premises, we see that Anna must also be an element of the set of students taking Discrete Math. Thus, it is not possible to have true premises and a false conclusion.   Process for Using a Venn diagram to Determine Validity    Draw the Venn diagram for each premise.  Statements such as All A are B mean A is a subset of B.  Make sure you distinguish between sets (lots of things have a certain property) and elements (a specific thing with a property).  See if it is possible for the premises to be true and the conclusion false.  Sometimes there is a choice about where to place a certain element of set. For example, if I know is not in set A, then might be in set B or it might not be in B. We can use these choices to see if we can make the premises true and the conclusion false.    Let's use this process on some more examples.  Determining Validity    All integers are rational numbers.  is not rational.  is not an integer.  The two premises are represented with the following diagram. Recall, is the set of rational numbers and is the set of integers.     We can see from the diagram that it is impossible to make the conclusion false. In particular, cannot be in the set of integers.  Consider the general form of universal modus ponens.  Draw the Venn diagram for universal modus ponens. You should have a circle labeled P and one labeled Q.  Write your own argument that has the form of universal modus tollens.  Use a Venn diagram with appropriate labels to show that your argument is valid.   Consider the general form of universal modus tollens.  Draw the Venn diagram for universal modus tollens. You should have a circle labeled P and one labeled Q.  Write your own argument that has the form of universal modus ponens.  Use a Venn diagram with appropriate labels to show that your argument is valid.   An Invalid Argument    All integers are rational numbers.  is rational.  is an integer.  The first premise is represented with the following diagram.     But we need to be careful about where we place . The second premise just says it needs to be inside the rational circle. Is it possible to place it in the rational circle so that the conclusion is false? Yes, we can place inside the rational circle, but not in the integer circle. So the following diagram shows how it is possible to have true premises and a false conclusion.    Therefore, the argument is invalid.    Invalid Arguments with Quantifiers  Converse error converse error quantifier   if then     is an example of converse error.  Inverse error inverse error quantifier   if then      Write your own example of inverse error. Use a Venn diagram to show your argument is invalid.  It will be useful to have some standard Venn diagrams for common forms of statements.   Venn Diagrams for Common Statements Venn diagram   All B are A.    Some A are B, or there exists an A that is a B.    No A are B.      For each argument use a Venn diagram to determine if the argument is valid or invalid.   Every Linfield student lives on campus.  Freya lives on campus.  Freya is a Linfield student.    Every polynomial function is differentiable.  is not a polynomial function.  is not differentiable.

  "body": " Direct Proof and Counterexample proof direct direct proof  Before starting proof techniques, we introduce a few mathematical definitons. Keep in mind, mathematical definitions are constructed to provide a common language for proofs. They are intended to provide rigor and precision. They are not intended to provide conceptual understanding. You need to develop conceptual understanding of the terms apart from the definition. However, we need to rely on definitions to provide structure for our proofs.  An integer, , is even even integer if it has the form for some .  An integer , is odd odd integer if it has the form for some .  You are probably familiar, generally, with even numbers such as 2, 4, 6, 8, and odd numbers such as 3, 5, 7, 9. But the next example uses the definitions to look at more examples.  Even or Odd  Is -5 even or odd?  where . Thus, -5 is odd.  Is 0 even or odd?  where . Thus, 0 is even.  Let . Is even or odd?  where . Thus is even.  Let . Is even or odd?  where . Thus is odd.   Let be integers. Determine if each of the following are always even, always odd, or sometimes even\/ sometimes odd.        We've now seen several examples of even\/ odd integers. Are there integers which are both even and odd? Can an integer be neither even nor odd? The answer to both questions is no. However, proving that every integer is even or odd (and not both), is pretty challenging, and we won't try to do it, yet. We will use this fact, though, so if we know an integer is not even, then it must be odd, and vice versa.  An integer, , is prime prime if and, for all positive integers , if then or .  An integer, , is composite composite if and for some positive integers with and .  Prime or Composite  Is 1 prime?  No. The definiton requires .  Is 1 composite?  No. Again, the definiton requires .  Is 121 prime?  No. . Thus, 121 is composite.  Let . Is composite?  It depends. If then, no. We would need for to be composite.    Consider the statement for all positive integers and , if then or from the definition for a prime number.  Write the statement symbolically using quantifiers and connectives.  Write the negation of the statement symbolically.  How is the negation related to the definition of a composite number? Is every integer either prime or composite?   We state our first proof technique.   Proving Existential Statements existential proof of  To prove   Find making, true. Note, this step may happen as scratchwork, not part of your proof.  For your proof, state .  Show and is true.    This type of proof is called a constructive proof of existence constructive proof existential statement   Existential Proof  Prove such that .  Let . Then and .   Another Existential Proof  Let . Prove such that .  Let . Then since and .   Let . Prove there exists such that .  There are other ways to prove existence. One common way is a proof by contradiction, which we will see later in . There are several examples of existence proofs in calculus where it can be shown that something exists without constructing a specific value. For example, take a look at a proof of Rolle's Theorem, the Mean Value Theorem, the Extreme Value Theorem, or the Taylor Remainder Theorem (Calc II).  Since the negation of a universal statement is an existential statement, we disprove a universal statements with a counterexample counterexample .   Counterexamples counterexample  To disprove the statement   Find the negation of the statement: .  Find making, true and false. Note, this step may happen as scratchwork, not part of your counterexample.  For your counterexample, state .  Show , is true and is false.     A counterexample is really just an existence proof of the negation. But since we are showing the original statement is false, we usually just call it a counterexample to the (original) statement.  Counterexample  Disprove the statement: Every prime number, , is odd.  Let . Then is prime and is not odd.   Give a counterexample to show the following statement is false: For all if then .  One of the most common mathematical statements is the universal conditional. We will see several techniques for proving . The first method, method of exhaustion, is very limited, but worth mentioning.   Method of Exhaustion proof method of exaustion  To prove , where is a finite set:  For each specific where is true, show is true.     Method of Exaustion  Prove for all , if is even and , then can be written as the sum of prime numbers.  We can find all the integers that are even and . This is the set . For each of these numbers we can demonstrate a way to write them as the sum of primes: .   The method of exhaustion only works if we can show the statement for every . But if is infinite, we need to use a more general method.   Method of Direct Proof proof direct direct proof  To prove :  Let (make sure this is a variable, or generic, , not a specific value).  Assume is true.  Show is true.    Direct Proof  Prove for all , if is even, then is odd.  Let be even. Then by definition, for some . Then where . Which means is odd.   Sum of Even Numbers  Prove the sum of two even integers is even.  Note, this statement is not obviously in the form of an if...then. We often have to translate statements into a more formal statement before proving them. Translation:  Prove for all if and are even, then is even.  Let be even. Then by definition, for some and for some . (Note, we cannot use for both and as they likely are two different numbers.) Then where . Which means is even.   Some proof writing advice:  Make the proof self-contained. Try not to reference many other mathematical facts. Many proofs in this course will rely entirely on definitions.  Use complete sentences. Even equations have a sentence structure. Your proof should be able to be read in sentences.  Give reasons. Connect your statements together.  Include words. Often using a word is better that using a symbol. Many proofs have no symbols in them at all.  The audience for your proofs is not the instructor. Think of the audience as being your peers in the course or even yourself in a few weeks (or months) when you might have forgotten the specific content. Write so you will know what you meant later.  The goal of a proof is to write a clear, easy to follow, argument--not to just get to the end. The answer is the proof itself. Use space, start a new line, set equations on their own line.  Never feel that you have to be able to know what the end of the proof will look like before you can start. Write proofs one step at a time. Start with what you know. See if you can do one thing. See if you can do another thing. Look at where you want to go. Do not try to see the whole picture at once. This is also good advice for reading a proof.   Some common proof-writing errors:  Using an example for a proof. If you need to prove a statement for all , it is not nough to show it for an example.  Using the same variable to represent two different things.  Jumping to conclusions. Giving inadequate reasons. This often occur if you rely on additional mathematical ideas or don't connect your ideas to each other.  Assuming what you need to prove. This is a big one. This most often occurs when there is confusion about conditional statements. Be careful about identifying the if and the then in a statement.   Often in math we need to identify whether a statement is true or false, so that we know whether we need to prove the true statement or disprove the false one.  Prove or Disprove  Prove or disprove there exists a positive integer such that is prime.  Since we need to try to decide if the statement is true or false, first try some examples.   After trying several examples, we might guess that it is false. If we want to disprove the statement then we need to prove the negation. Find the negation of the statement.  For all positive integers is not prime (is composite).  So we need to show that for a general we can always write as a product of with .  We can try to factor the expression: .  Let . We need to show that . Since and . Thus . Therefore, is not prime.   Prove or disprove the following statements.  If is even, then is even.  If is odd, then is odd.  If and are odd, then their product, , is odd.    Check Your Understanding  True or false: is odd. False.  True or false: is even. False.  True or false: is odd. True.  True or false: is even. True.  True or false: if is even, then is even. True.  True or false: 99 is composite. True.  True or false: -99 is composite. False.  True or false: is prime. False.     Use the definitions of even, odd, prime, and composite to justify your answer to each of the following questions. Let and be integers.    Is even?    Is odd?    If , is composite?      Prove there are integers and such that and and is an integer.    Prove there is an integer such that is prime.    Disprove by giving a counterexample: For all real numbers and , if then .    Disprove by giving a counterexample: For all integers, and , if is odd then and are both odd.    Find the mistakes in the following proof.    Theorem: For all integers , if then is composite.   Proof : For , . But , and so 9 is composite. Hence the theorem is true.    Find the mistakes in the following proof.    Theorem: The difference between any odd integer and any even integer is odd.   Proof : Suppose is an odd integer, and is an even integer. By definition of odd, where is an integer, and by definition of even where is an integer. Then Since 1 is odd the difference between an odd integer and and even integer is odd.    Prove the difference of any even integer minus any odd integer is odd.    Prove the sum of any two odd integers is even.    Prove the following statement is false: There exists an integer such that is prime.    For the following problems determine if they are true of false. Prove the true statements and provide counterexamples for the false statements.    The product of any even integer and any integer is even.    For all integers , if is prime then .    For all integers , is a prime number.      "

  "body": " Rational Numbers rational number  In this section we introduce the formal definition of a rational number and use it practice with the technique of direct proof.  A real number, , is rational rational number if there exist such that and . Notation: the set of ratioanl numbers is the set of rational numbers.  A real number, , that is not rational is irrational irrational number . There is not a nice notation for the irrational numbers. We will use the set of irratioanl numbers , which is the set of real numbers minus the set of rationals.  To determine if a given number is rational, we need to be able to find a way to write it as a fraction of integers. To prove a number is rational is really a type of existence proof--we need to show exist. To prove a number is not rational, we need to show there is no possible way to write it as a fraction of integers. Also, keep in mind that rational and irrational numbers first need to be real numbers. It is possible that a number that is not rational is not a real number, and thus, not irrational either.  Rational Numbers  Is O is rational?  Yes: .  Is 2 rational?  Yes: .  Is rational?  Yes: is already has the form of an integer over an integer.  Is rational?  No: the denominator cannot be 0. In fact, is not a number.   You have seen some common examples of irrational numbers in previous courses: . It is, in fact, challenging to prove these are irrational. We will see the proof that is irrational later in this course.  In your previous experience with rational and irrational numbers, you may have seen the property that rational numbers are ones with terminating or repeating decimal expansions, while irrational numbers have non-terminating and non-repeating decimal expansions. The next couple of examples explore this property.  is Rational  Show is a rational number.  We need to find such that and . We can use what we know about decimals: for example, etc. Thus, . Letting , we can see that .   is Rational  Show the repeating decimal is a rational number.  We need to find such that and . This one is trickier than the last example and requires a new technique. First, let . Then multiply both sides of by 1000, so that . We chose 1000 in order to get one set of the repeated digits in front of the decimal point. Now we subtract the two equations from each other: Resulting in . Now we just solve for : .  Letting , we can see that .   Prove the following numbers, , are rational by finding integers, and so that .      The next theorem gives us an example of how to prove more general statements with rational numbers.  The sum of two rational numbers is rational.   Let be rational. Show is rational.  Since is rational, it can be written as for some . Similarly, since is rational, it can be written as for some . (Note, we need to use different letters since and are not necessarily the same.) Now, Finding a common denominator,   Then and, since . Therefore, is rational.   Once we have proven a theorem, we can use it to prove additional statements. Note, a corollary is just a theorem that follows almost directly from a previous theorem.  The double of a rational number is rational.  Let be a rational number. We want to show is rational. But . By , is rational.  Let be rational numbers.  Prove is rational.  Prove is rational.

Prove the following numbers are rational by writing them as a ratio of two integers.                The zero product property says that if a product of two real numbers is 0 then one of the numbers must be zero.    Write this property formally using quantifiers and variables.    Write the contrapositive of your answer in (a).    Write an informal version (without symbols and variables) of your answer to part (b).      Prove every integer is a rational number.    Find the mistakes in the following proof.    Theorem: The sum of any two rational numbers is rational.   Proof : Suppose and are rational numbers. If is rational, then by definition of rational for integers and with . Since and are rational, and for integers and with and . Thus which is the quotient of two integers with nonzero denominator. Thus, it is rational.   Consider the statement: The square of any rational number is a rational number.    Write the statement formally using a quantifier and a variable.    Determine whether the statement is true or false and justify your answer.     Determine if the following statements are true or false. For true statements provide a proof. For false statements provide a counterexample and determine if a small change would make the statement true. If so, correct the statement and provide a proof of the new statement.    The quotient of any two rational numbers is a rational number.    If and are rational numbers then is a rational number.      Suppose , , , and are integers and . Suppose also that is a real number that satisfies the equation Must be rational? If so, express as a ratio of two integers. Is the condition important?  Solve for .   "

Now that we have the concept of divisibility, we can look at some bigger mathematical theorems involving divisibility by primes.  Any integer is divisible by a prime.  We will divide this proof into two cases, where is prime and where is composite.  Case 1: is prime. We can see that . Since n is prime, is divisible by a prime.  Case 2: is composite. Then where , and . If is prime, then is divisible by a prime.  If is not prime, then where , and . If is prime, then and is divisible by a prime.  Similarly, if is not prime, then where , and , etc.  We can keep applying this process to get with , and .  If at any point is prime, then we are done, as we have found a prime divisor of . We know that there cannot be infinitely many non-prime since there are only finitely many integers between 1 and . Thus, the process must terminate with a prime divisor of . Hence, every integer is divisible by a prime.   We now state a big theorem in discrete mathematics, but leave the proof for later. This theorem is more commonly called the Fundamental Theorem of Arthmetic.

  "body": " Proof by Cases proof by cases  In this section we will learn another proof technique, proof by cases. We will also see another big discrete math theorem, the Quotient-Remainder Theorem.  In the last section, we looked at the idea of divisibility. Remember, this is a relationship between two integers, not actual division. We will continue to focus on integers. One of the issues with division of integers is that if you divide two integers, you no longer necessarily have an integer. What if the only numbers we are allowed to use are integers? Can we still somehow think of division? Well, yes, this is in fact how you were probably introduced to division long ago. When you were first learning arithmetic, you only worked with integers.  Suppose you want to divide 10 by 5. This is easy, . But what if you want to divide 10 by 4? Now 4 does not go evenly into 10 (in other words, 4 does not divide 10). In this case, we get a remainder. In particular, 4 goes into 10 two times with a remainder of 2. Or, has quotient 2 and remainder 2.  OK, we want to formalize this idea of division, making sure we are only using integers. We know 5 divides 10, since . Can we do the same sort of thing for 10 and 4? Almost. In this case, .  In general, given any integers with , we can find integers with . In general, are not unique. For example, , and , and . But as we noted, we want to think of as the remainder. If we are more specific about conditions on the remainder, then and are unique.  The Quotient-Remainder Theorem Quotient-Remainder Theorem Division Algorithm Quotient-Remainder Theorem Given any integer and any positive integer , there exist unique integers such that and .  We say is the quotient quotient and is the remainder remainder when is divided by .  We will see the existence part of the proof in .  This theorem is usually called the Division Algorithm. We won't use that name here since it can be confusing. In particular, the Division Algorithm is not really an algorithm.  Some important observations: the remainder must be nonnegative. It can be 0. This is what happens when . Although can be any integer, we will limit to being positive. The Quotient-Remainder Theorem can be extended to any , but we will just need in this class.  Finding Quotients and Remainders  Let , Find the quotient and remainder .   Let , Find the quotient and remainder .   Let , Find the quotient and remainder .   Let , Find the quotient and remainder .   Let , Find the quotient and remainder .    For the given and , find and as in the Quotient-Remainder Theorem.  and  and  and  and   In computer science it is useful to have functions that give the quotient (div) and remainder (mod). The common notation is  For example, and . quotient when is divided by remainder when is divided by  We can use the Quotient-Remainder Theorem to find representations of the integers integer remainder representation by grouping integers with the same remainder.  For example, if we let , what are the possible remainders? In this case, or . Thus, there are two possible forms for : or . We see that these are the two forms corresponding to being even or odd. Now, as a corollary of the Quotient-Remainder, we have that every integer must be even or odd.  We can use the Quotient-Remainder Theorem to get other forms, as well. For example, if , the possible forms are or . We can use these forms to get different cases for the integers.   Proof by Cases proof by cases cases proof by  To prove by cases,  Break into smaller subsets, . Make sure every element in is in one of the subsets.  Prove each case separately. Make sure you state each case clearly.  Case 1:   Proof of .  Case 2:  Proof of .  etc.  Conclude holds for all .   In choosing your subsets, make sure you cover all the elements of . Your subsets do not need to be similar. For example, one set could be all the nonzero integers and the other just the set with 0.  We saw an example in , where we broke into the set of primes and the set of composites.  Proof by Cases  Prove given any two consecutive integers, one is even and one is odd.  Let and be consecutive integers.  Case 1: Let be even. Then for some . Then for . Hence is odd.  Case 2: Let be odd. Then for some . Then for . Hence is even.  Thus, for any two consecutive integers, one is even and one is odd.   Prove for all integers and , and are either both even or both odd. There are four cases, depending on whether and are even or odd.  Recall the absolute value function is defined as Prove for all , . What would appropriate cases be?  More Cases  Prove that the square of any odd integer has the form for some .  First, let's try to just prove this directly.  Let be odd. Then . Thus, .  It is not clear has the form .  If we try using some cases, we may get a bit more to work with. We know any integer has the form or . But only and are odd. Thus, we can try cases with and .  Let be odd.  Case 1: Let for some . Then for some . Let . Then has the form .  Case 2: Let for some . Then for some . Let . Then has the form .  Thus, any odd integer has the form .  Note, what this theorem really says is that the square of an odd integer must have remainder 1 when divided by 8. That might be a little surprising.

  "body": " Proof by Contradiction and Contrapositive proof by contradiction proof by contrapositive contradiction proof contrapositive proof  In this section we will learn two new proof techniques, contradiction and contrapositive. Both proof techniques rely on being able to negate mathematical statements.  As we add more proof techniques, it is important to realize that you are not expected to know which technique to use when you start a proof. Proof-writing often takes some trial and error. First try a direct proof, if you get stuck, you may think about whether breaking your set into cases will help, or whether negating a statement will make it easier to use. It is also quite possible that different methods can be used to prove the same statement.   Method of Proof by Contradiction proof by contradiction contradiction proof   Assume the statement to be proved is false. Or, assume the negation is true.  Show you reach some logical contradiction.  Conclude the original statement is true.    There Is No Greatest Integer  Prove there is no greatest integer.  By contradiction. Assume there is a greatest integer. Call this greatest integer . Now consider . Since is an integer, is an integer. We can see that , which contradicts that was the greatest. Therefore, there is no greatest integer.   Since contradiction relies on negating statements, recall the following negations:  has negation  has negation  has negation    Consider the statement: The sum of a rational number and an irrational number is irrational.  Try to determine if the statement is true or false by trying examples and looking for a counterexample.  Write the statement using variables and quantifiers.  Write the negation of the statement.  Now assume the negation is true and find a contradiction.  The work in (d) is your scratch work. Write a careful proof by contradiction to show the original statement is true.  Recall from that a conditional, , and its contrapositive, , are logically equivalent. This means we can prove the contrapositive rather than the original statement.   Method of Proof by Contrapositive proof by contrapositive contrapositive proof   Write the statement to be proved in the form , if then .  Write the contrapositive of the statement: , if then .  Prove the contrapositive directly: assume , show .    A Divisibility Proof by Contrapositive  Prove for all , if then .  This statement has contrapositive: For all , if then .  By contrapositive. Let . Assume . This means for some . Then , where . Thus, .   Consider the statement: For all integers , if is even then is even.  Write the contrapositive of the statement.  To prove the statement by contrapositive, what should you assume?  To prove the statement by contrapositive, what should you show?  Give a direct proof of the contrapositive. You have now proven the original statement by contrapositive.   Since we can use either contradiction or contrapositive on statements of the form , the following comparison may be helpful.   Comparing Contradiction and Contrapositive  Contradiction with :  Assume .  Show any contradiction. The contradiction may be or it may be , or some other logical contradiction.  Since you can reach any contradiction at all, it may be difficult to know what you are looking for. It also may be difficult to know if you've made an error.  With contradiction you get to assume more, but it is less clear what you want to show.    Contrapositive with :  Assume .  Show .  With contrapositive you assume less than contradiction, but you know exactly what you are trying to show.      Check Your Understanding  Give the negation for the statement: There does not exist a greatest odd integer. There exists a greatest odd integer.  Give the negation for the statement: For all real numbers , if is not rational then is not rational. There exists a real number such that is rational and is not rational.  Suppose you want to prove the following statement by contradiction: For all real numbers , if is not rational then is not rational. What should you assume? What should you show? Assume: there exists a real number such that is rational and is not rational. Show: any contradiction.  Give the contrapositive for the statement: For all real numbers , if is not rational then is not rational. For all real numbers if is rational then is rational.  Suppose you want to prove the following statement by contrapositive: For all real numbers , if is not rational then is not rational. What should you assume? What should you show? Assume: is real, is rational. Show: is rational.  Give the negation for the statement: For all integers and primes , if then . There exists an integer and a prime such that and .  Suppose you want to prove the following statement by contradiction: For all integers and primes , if then . What should you assume? What should you show? Assume: there exists an integer and a prime such that and . Show any contradiction.  Give the contrapositive for the statement: For all integers and primes , if then . For all integers if then .

  "body": " More Proof by Contradiction and Contrapositive  In this section we will use contradiction and contrapositive to prove two classical theorems in mathematics.  In you used contrapositive to prove if is even, then is even. This statement is an important step in our first big theorem. We state it here formally as a lemma.  Let . If is even, then is even.  We will prove this by contrapositive. Assume is odd. Show is odd. Since is odd, for some . Then Since , is odd.   is irrational.  We will prove this by contradiction. Assume is rational. Then with . We will additionally assume and have no common factors. [Note, this additional assumption just makes the proof simpler. You should convince yourself that it is reasonable to add this assumption--that given any fraction, we can always reduce so and have no common factors.]  Now, using algebra on the equations, Since , must be even. Then by , must be even.  Since is even, for some . Thus, we can substitute into the above equation. Since , must be even. Then by , must be even.  But now we have and both even, which means they both have a common factor of 2. This contradicts our assumption that and have no common factors. Since we reached a contradiction, we can conclude that is irrational.   Make sure you can read through the above proof and follow from one step to the next.  In and , we proved if is even then is even. Now suppose you want to prove if is divisible by 3 then is divisible by 3.  To prove the statement by contrapositive, what should you assume?  To prove the statement by contrapositive, what should you show?  The problem with now giving a direct proof of the contrapositive, is that we need to know what we mean by is not divisible by 3. Recall the Quotient-Remainder Theorem, . If is not divisible by 3, what are the possible forms for ? Think of the forms for .  Now write a proof by cases using the cases for from (c) to show if is not divisible by 3, then is not divisible by 3.   Our second classical theorem is to prove there are infinitely many prime numbers. We previously proved there are infinitely many integers. In that proof, if we had a biggest integer, , we were able to construct an integer that was greater than , namely . However, primes are not that nice. If you were to list out several prime numbers, it would be impossible to find a pattern for the next prime. Sometimes primes are close together, like 17 and 19, and sometimes they are far apart. In fact, it is possible to prove that we can find a list of consecutive integers where none of the consecutive integers are prime for any positive integer . This means there are arbitrarily long sequences of consecutive integers with no primes, or there are primes that are arbitrarily far apart.  First we need to understand a bit more about divisibilty with primes.  Consider the statement: For all and primes , if then .  Write the contrapositive of the statement.  Write the negation of the statement.  Based on the contrapositive and the negation, which seem easier to use in a proof?  Assume and . Can you find a contradiction?  If you were able to find a contradiction, try to write a careful proof by contradiction for the statement.   The statement in is an important lemma for proving there are infinitely many primes.  For all and all primes , if then .  We will prove this by contradiction. Let , prime. Assume and . Since , for some . Since , for some . Thus, Since , and is a factor of 1. However, the only factors of 1 are 1 and -1, which are not prime. Thus, we have a contradiction.   There are infinitely many primes.  Assume there are finitely many primes. Since there are finitely many, we can list them all, say, . Now let , the product of all the primes. Consider . We know for each prime . By , . This means is an integer greater than 1 with no prime divisor, which contradicts .   Check Your Understanding  Let . Give the contrapositive for the statement: if , then . If then .  Suppose you are given that . Use the Quotient-Remainder Theorem ( ) to list the possible cases for . What are the possible values for the remainder, ?

Although many sequences themselves are straightfoward, such as , we need to introduce notation and terminology for working with general sequences.  A sequence sequence is an ordered list.  We use the notation for a general sequence.  Each is called a term sequence term in the sequence. The subscript is called the index sequence index . The index will be an integer, and almost always a nonnegative integer. The first term (or sometimes ) is called the initial term sequence initial term . The term is called the term. It is also often called the general term of the sequence.  Sequences Consider the sequence . The initial term is . The term is .  We need to be careful with subscripts. For example, , but . If we add 1 to the index, we get the next term, which is not the same as adding 1 to the term.  Explicitly Defined Sequences We can define a sequence by giving the general term.  Let .

When we get to mathematical induction in the next section, it will be important that we can work with summations when we want to add the term to a summation. In particular, the following observation is useful:   We should also note that there are often multiple ways to write the same sum.  Writing a Sum in Two Different Ways  Consider the sum .

  "body": " Mathematical Induction mathematical induction induction  In this section we learn a new proof technique, mathematical induction. This technique is useful for proving statements about the positive (or nonnegative) integers. It is based on the following principle.   Principle of Mathematical Induction  Let be a property defined for integers , and let be a fixed integer. Suppose the following are true: is true;  For all with , if is true than is true; then for all , is true.   The way to think about the Principle of Mathematical Induction is that if you know the statement is true for some starting value, ( is true), and if you can show that knowing the statement is true for some value allows you to know it is true for the next value ( ), then you know it for all values greater than or equal to .  So why should this work? Suppose you know two things:  is true, and   .  Note, you do not know is true, just that if it is true, then will be true. Now since is true, by (2.), must be true. Since is true, must be true, etc. In this way we can see that must be true for all .  The Principle of Mathematical Induction lets us skip all the intermediate steps, and conclude once we have (1.) and (2.).  Induction proofs follow a fairly formal structure. You are encouraged to follow the structure closely.   Structure of a Mathematical Induction Proof proof by induction induction proof structure  To prove ,  Base Step Show is true.  Induction Step Assume for some , show .  Conclude is true for all   In the above structure we used for simplicitiy, but an induction proof could have a base step starting at a different . Most commonly, the base step starts with 0 or 1.  When writing induction proofs, make sure you use the actual statement you are proving rather than the notation .  Since the induction step in mathematical induction connects a statement about to a statement about , we need to be comfortable with the relationship between sums of terms and sums of terms.  Write out the summation for .  Write out the summation for .  How do (a) and (b) differ?   Proof by Induction: Summation Formula  Prove for .   Base Step: Let . Then Since the left hand side of the equation equals the right hand side, for .  Induction Step:  Assume for some .  Show .  Proof of induction step: Thus, .  Hence, by induction for .    Note, in the base step we looked at each side of what we wanted to show separately. We can refer to this as a left hand side\/ right hand side proof , or in short hand, a LHS\/RHS proof. If we just start with the equation we want to show, then we are assuming what we are trying to prove. To avoid this, it is best, when trying to show two things are equal in the base step, to do a LHS\/ RHS proof.  now gives us a useful formula for finding the sum of 1 through :  Before the next example, we practice the relationship between sums of terms and sums of terms.  Write out the summation for .  Write out the summation for .  How do (a) and (b) differ?   Proof by Induction: Geometric Sum  Prove for .   Base Step: Let .

  "body": " More Mathematical Induction mathematical induction  In the last section we introduced mathematical induction by looking at proofs involving summation formulas. In this section we look at some more examples, including divisibility proofs and inequality proofs.  As in the previous section, we will assume . We will continue to use the same . Before looking at new examples of induction proofs, let's make sure we can write a summation proof.   Prove for all by induction. Make sure your proof follows the form above.   Our next example looks at using induction to prove a divisibility statement. We proved several properties of divisibility in . Now we want to be able to use those properties to simplify our induction proofs. Remember, a written proof just needs to make a clear series of logical steps. It does not need to explain how the writer thought to do those steps.  Proof by Induction: Divisibility  Prove for .   Base Step: Let . Then . We know .  Thus, for .  Induction Step:  Assume for some .  Show .  Scratchwork: before proving the induction step, we might need to do some scratchwork. This is not part of the proof, but will help us structure a clear proof. We can do some algebra on the expression we in the show statement: But by our assumption, and since the remaining terms are multiples of 3, .  Now we are ready to use our scratch work to write the proof of the induction step.  Proof of induction step: Which is what we wanted to show.  Hence, by induction for .    Some comments about divisibility proofs:  You will likely need to do scratchwork. Do not include the scratchwork in your actual proof.  The point of the proof is that the reader can follow all of the steps. You do not need to explain where your choices came from. For example, in the proof in , it might not be obvious why you should add , but the reader just needs to know that 3 divides the expression, which is clear.  Divisibility proofs in this form can be challenging to do at first, but with practice, they often end up being some of the easier induction proofs to do, as they all follow a similar format.   Let's try another example.  Proof by Induction: Divisibility, Again  Prove for .   Base Step: Let . Then . We know .  Thus, for .  Induction Step:  Assume for some .  Show .  Scratchwork: But by our assumption, and since the remaining term is a multiple of 3, .  Now we are ready to use our scratchwork to write the proof of the induction step.  Proof of induction step: Which is what we wanted to show.  Hence, by induction for .    Prove for all by induction. It may be helpful to do scratchwork first.  Now we apply induction to statements involving inequalities. These will be some of the most challenging induction proofs as they often take a bit more trial and error in the scratchwork. When dealing with equalities , you know that you have to add the same thing to both sides. However, with inequalities you can change one side as long as you maintain the inequality. For example, if you know , then you also know . The fact that we can change one side of the expression makes it more challenging to see what steps to take.  Proof by Induction: Inequality  Prove for .   Base Step: Let . Then , and We know .  Thus, for .  Induction Step:  Assume for some .  Show .  Scratchwork: Now we want to make a useful observation: in the LHS expression we are addding. In the RHS expression we are multiplying. We need a way to go between them. One way is to notice that .

This is really just regular induction except we make a stronger assumption in the induction hypothesis. It is possible that we need to show more than one base case as well, but for the moment we will just look at how and why we may need to change the assumption.  strong induction induction strong  Stong Induction  Let be a property defined for integers . If  are true for some , and  if is true for all , then is true;  then we can conclude is true for all .   As in the previous sections on induction, we will assume .  Strong induction requires a change in how we write our induction assumption, so we need a slight change to our standard structure for a strong induction proof.   Structure of a Strong Induction Proof strong induction proof structure   Base Step Assume is true.  Induction Step Assume is true for all . Show is true.   For now, we can use in the base step and just do one base step as before. But we might need to show, say, and .   The only real difference between strong induction and regular induction is that instead of assuming , we assume . In notation, this is for all .  Why can we change the assumption? Well, remember how induction works, first we show , then the induction step gets us to , which then gets us to , etc. But once we get to, say, , we already know . Thus, we may as well assume we have for everything up to .  To see the necessity of a stronger assumption, we revisit , by using induction to prove every integer is divisible by a prime. First we will attempt to use regular induction and see why it isn't enough.  Trying Regular Induction  Prove for all integers , is divisible by a prime.  First we try to do the proof using regular induction.   Base Step: Let . Then and 2 is prime.  Thus, is divisible by a prime.  Induction Step:  Assume is divisible by a prime for some .  Show is divisible by a prime.  Proof of induction step:  Case 1: is prime. Now, and hence is divisible by a prime.  Case 2: is not prime. This is were we get stuck, since although we know is divisible by a prime, that doesn't tell us anything about . In fact, we showed that any prime dividing  cannot divide .  Thus, regular induction is not going to work for this proof.    Now we can show how to do the proof with strong induction.  Strong Induction  Prove for all integers , is divisible by a prime.  The only change in the structure is to the induction assumption.   Base Step: Let . Then and 2 is prime.  Thus, is divisible by a prime.  Induction Step:  Assume is divisible by a prime for all and for some .  Show is divisible by a prime.  Proof of induction step:  Case 1: is prime. Now, and hence is divisible by a prime.  Case 2: is not prime. Thus where . Then . By our induction assumption, must be divisible by a prime. Since and is divisible by a prime, is divisible by a prime.  Thus, by induction, every is divisible by a prime.    In regular induction, we use that we know the statement holds for to get that it holds for . Strong induction is useful when we need to use some smaller case (not just ) to get the statement for .  Let be the sequence defined as   Write out the first 6 terms of the sequence.  Convince yourself that for the first six terms of the sequence, .  Now try to write a standard induction proof to prove for all . Does anything go wrong?  The proof requires strong induction. For the base step, how many previous terms do you need before you can first compute using the formula provided in defining the sequence? You need to show the base step for each of these initial terms since the induction won't apply to them. Check the base step for each of these terms.  Write the assume and show statements for the inductive step. Make sure your assume statement is in the form for strong induction.  Now prove the inductive step.  For the remainder of the section, we are going to switch gears a bit, a prove the existence part of the Quotient-Remainder Theorem. Before we do that we need the Well-Ordering Principle, which we will state without a proof.  Well-Ordering Principle Well-Ordering Principle Let be a set containing one or more integers, all of which are greater than some fixed integer. Then has a least element.  To check that the Well-Ordering Principle applies, you need to check three things:    Every element of is greater than some fixed integer.   Well-Ordering Principle  First note that the Well-Ordering Principle does not apply if the set is not integers. For example, This is not a subset of the integers and does not have a least element, even though every element is greater than 0.  Now consider . Check each of the conditions.  since .  since .

  "body": " Defining Sequences Recursively sequence recursive  We've seen sequences defined explicitly, such as . Another common way to generate a sequence is by giving a rule for how to generate the next term from the previous term. For example, where . Such sequences are called recursively defined sequences recursively defined sequence .  Explicitly Defined Sequences explicit sequence sequence explicit  Find the first five terms of the sequence given by .   Find the first five terms of the sequence given by .   Write out the first 6 terms of the sequence .  Recursively Defined Sequences  Find the first five terms of the sequence given by .   Find the first five terms of the sequence given by .   Find the first five terms of the sequence given by .   Write out the first 6 terms of the sequence .  Although both types of sequences use an equation to find , the recursive sequence also needs to define the first few terms. If we change the initial terms, we get a different sequence. The formula used to generate the recursive sequence is called a recurrence relation recurrence relation , while the first term (or terms) is called the initial condition(s) .  An advantage of an explicitly defined sequence is that it is easy to find any particular term. For example, it would be easy to calculate in . In order to find in , we would need to know , and all the terms before that. So we would need to have generated the sequence up to that point to calculate a specific term.  Recursive sequences have the advantage that they can be faster (or computationally simpler) to calculate, especially if you need to generate many terms of the sequence. Computers are good at generating recursive sequences. It also may be the case that we can easily define a recursive sequence in which it is difficult, or even impossible, to express with an explicit formula.  The Fibonacci Sequence Fibonacci sequence sequence Fibonacci  The Fibonacci sequence is defined recursively by Give the first 6 terms of the Fibonacci sequence.   Write out the 7th, 8th, and 9th terms of the Fibonacci sequence.  The Fibonacci sequence is a good example of a recursively defined sequence where it is difficult to find an explicit formula. An explicit formula for the Fibonacci sequence does exist, we will see it in the next section and in , but it requires much more sophisticated mathematics to find it than anything we will see in this course. If you are interested, though, this is the sort of thing you would see if you take a combinatorics course. When we do see the formula, it should be clear that it is computationally much harder to work with than the recursive definiton (which is why you rarely see it when working with the Fibonacci sequence).  We would like to explore the connection between recursive and explicit sequences.  Write out the first 6 terms of . Is this an explicitly or recursively defined sequence?  Consider the recurrence relationship . Write out several terms of the sequence for a couple different choices of initial terms.  How do the sequences in (a) and (b) compare?  We want to be able to show the relationship between the recursive definition and the explicit definition for a sequence. In this section we will look at proving an explicit sequence satisfies a given recurrence relation. Since, in general, explict formulas contain more information than a recurrence relation, we can use simpler proof techniques to show an explicit sequence satisfies a recurrence relation.   Proving a Sequence Satisfies a Recurrence Relation recurrence relation proof  To prove an explicity defined sequence satisfies a recurrence relation:  Assume the explicit formula for the sequence.  Show, using a LHS\/RHS proof, that the recurrence relation holds.  This is always a direct proof. Do not use induction. We will see induction in the next section.   Proving a Recurrence Relation for an Explicit Sequence  Let . Show this sequence satisfies the recurrence relation , for .   Assume for all . Show this sequence statisfies the recurrence relation .  LHS: , since we know that satisfies the explicit formula.  RHS: , since we know that satisfies the explicit formula.  Simplifying, we get .  Thus, the LHS=RHS, hence .

We have been using some of the set notation throughout the course. We review it here for convenience. We usually use capital letters for sets, such as or . If we want to talk about elements in a set , we use the notation . We read this notation as is in or is an element of . If is not in , then we use the notation .  In general, if we use to describe a property of , we use the notation   and read the statement as \" in such that has property .\"  We gave an initial definition of subset in , and introduced the notation for subset: . Now that we will be working with sets more formally, we give a more formal definition of a subset, which will be easier to use in proofs.  is a subset subset of , , if for all , if then .  is a not a subset of , , if there exists , such that and .    We say two sets are equal , , if and .  is a proper subset proper subset of if and .   To important sets are the universal set set universal , , which is the set of everything, and the empty set empty set , , which is the set with nothing. The universal set depends on the context. For example, in calculus, the universal set is often the set of real numbers. In number theory, it could just be the integers. In computer science, it could be the set of sequences of 0 and 1. When dealing with abstract sets, we might want to define a convenient universal set.  We now give the element definitions for common set operations, along with the Venn diagrams for each of the sets.  The set is the union union of sets set union of sets and where union if and only if or .  In set notation, .

One of our goals in this section is to learn how to prove properties such as the following subset relations.  subset properties  Subset Relations   ; .  ; .  Transitivity If and then .

This type of proof uses elements and the definitions of sets and subsets. You start with being an element of the set of interest, use what you know about the set to then get as an element of another set. This technique generalizes to sets in all different mathematical contexts.  The next theorem shows that the empty set is a subset of every set.  For all sets , .  By contradiction, assume there exists a set such that .  This means there exists such that . But we cannot have . Hence, we have a contradiction. Therefore, .   There are many times in mathematics that we need to prove that a set is empty. We might need do do this if we need sets to be disjoint, or if we need to prove that there are no elements with a particular property. The common method for proving a set is empty is to use contradiction. Note, usually if we want to prove , we show both subsets ( , ), but we just showed , always. So we just need to show .

  "title": "Algebraic Proofs and Counterexamples",
  "body": " Algebraic Proofs and Counterexamples  The proofs we did in the last section involved looking at elements in sets. We could translate statements about sets into logical statement such as and s, or s, and conditionals. This allowed us to prove many other properties of sets, such as DeMorgan's Laws. But now that we have these properties, we can use them to prove new properties in a more algebraic way.  First we look at how to disprove statements involving sets. As we saw in , we can disprove a statement with a counterexample.  To prove a statement is false, give a specific counterexample. This means defining specific sets for which the property fails. If you are trying to decide if a statement is true or false, you can experiment with small sets, or you can draw a Venn diagram. The Venn diagram itself is not a proof or a counterexample. But it can help you decide which you should be trying to find.  Finding a Counterexample Prove or disprove if and , then .  This statement is false. Our counterexample should satisfy the negation of the statement: , and . Find small sets that satisfy the negation.  For example, we can try . Then , and . Thus, we have a counterexample.   Advice for finding counterexamples:  Write the negation of the statement so you can make sure your sets satisfy the appropriate conditions.  Most counterexamples for the types of statements we see in this chapter can be found without needing to find tricky sets. So just try something, it will probably work.  You might need to be careful about whether your sets intersect or not.  If you need counterexamples that involve set complements, it is helpful to define a small universal set such as . Then if , , which is easier to work with than, say, all the integers except 1, 2, 3.   Now we want to be able to use the list of properties from the end of the previous section, , to prove statements algebraically. In this case, we do not need to use elements, but we can use properties such as the distributive property or DeMorgan's Laws to rewrite our sets.  Algebraic Set Theory Proof  Prove using properties of sets.    Use identities from the to prove for all sets and ,  Prove or disprove for all sets and , . To decide if a statement is true or false, draw a Venn diagram for each side of the equality. If the two diagrams are the same, provide a proof. If the two diagrams are different, provide a specific counterexample.  Prove or disprove for all sets and , if then . It might be easier to define a small universal set for this one.  Recall the power set of a set , power set , is the set of all subsets of .  Power Set Proof  Prove for all sets and , .  Since we need to show two sets are equal we need to show both subsets. We should also note that elements of power sets are sets.  : Let . Then must be a subset of . Then and . This implies and . Thus, .  : Let . Then and . Then and . This implies must be a subset of . Thus, .    You might have noticed in this last proof that each of the subset proofs are really just the reverse of each other. If all the implications in our proof are really if and only if statements, then we can write the proof more succinctly as a single if and only if proof. We will show this technique in the next example. Be careful with if and only if proofs, though. Make sure that at each step both directions of the conditional are true. If you are unsure, you can always write you proof in two stages, as we did in the previous example. We generally use the symbol if and only if in proofs to mean if and only if in proofs.  Power Set Proof, Shortened  Prove for all sets , .      Since we are looking at the power set, we can prove a formula for counting the number of elements of a power set. In this proof we will revisit proof by induction. The number of elements in a set, , is denoted the number of elements in .  If has elements, then has elements.   We will prove this by induction on the number of elements, .  Base step: Let . Then since has 0 elements, . The only subset of the empty set is . Thus, . Hence, . Since , if , has elements.  Induction step: Assume if a set has elements, then has elements.  Show if a set has elements, then has elements.  Proof of induction step: Assume . Let , then where , the set of elements of except . Then has elements, so by the induction assumption, .  Now consider the subsets of . Each subset either contains or it doesn't. We know there are subsets that do not contain . We get all the subsets of that do contain by adding to the sets that don't contain . Thus, there are the same number of subsets that do contain as those that don't. Hence, we have subsets not containing and subsets containing .  Therefore, has subsets, hence has elements.   The next example demonstrates the proof of in a specific set.  Counting the Number of Subsets  Let . We can separate out the last element so, as in the proof of , .  We can look at the subsets of that do not contain 3: Now add 3 to each of these sets: You can check that we have all the possible subsets of .  If we count up the sets, we have subsets not containing 3, and subsets containing 3. Which gives us subsets of . Hence, .    Check Your Understanding  Let be sets and be the universal set.

In particular, we define the reflexive, symmetric, and transitive properties. We will use directed graphs to identify the properties and look at how to prove whether a relation is reflexive, symmetric, and\/or transitive.  Let be a relation on .

Note, this property does not mean , just that if a pair is in , then the reverse is as well.  is transitive since if and then . Note, this property can be tedious to check by hand. In this example, though, the only pairs that fit the hypothesis are pairs like , so , which is in .   Another Look at the Properties  Let , define the relation on by  is not reflexive since .  is not symmetric since , but not .  is transitive since if and then .  Check: , so , which is in . This is the only set of ordered pairs where the second coordinate of the first pair matches the first coordinate of the second pair.   We can use directed graphs to help identify the properties.  Reflexive  If a relation is reflexive, then the directed graph will have an arrow from the vertex to itself (a loop) at every vertex.   Directed graph for reflexive property      Symmetric If a relation is symmetric, then whenever the directed graph has an arrow from vertex, to vertex , there is a corresponding arrow going from to .   Directed graph for symmetric property      Transitive If a relation is transitive, then whenever the directed graph has an arrow from vertex, to vertex followed by an arrow from to , there is a corresponding arrow going from to .   Directed graph for transitive property        The transitive closure transitive closure of a relation , denoted , is the set of ordered pairs in as well as all additional ordered pairs to make the relation transitive.  Transitive Closure  Let . Then in we need . You can check with a directed graph to see this is the only pair we need to add. Thus, .  Let . Let .  Determine if is reflexive.

Determine if is reflexive.  Determine if is symmetric.  Determine if is transitive.  Draw the directed graph for .  If is not transitive, what ordered pairs should you add to the relation to make transitive?  Checking that a relation is reflexive, symmetric, or transitive on a small finite set can be done by checking that the property holds for all the elements of .

  "title": "Equivalence Relations",
  "body": " Equivalence Relations equivalence relation relation equivalence  In we studied three properties of a relation, the reflexive, symmetric, and transitive properties. These three properties are important for generalizing the idea of equality in mathematics. We may want to relate objects based on certain criteria; objects that share that criteria are equivalent. For example, you may recall from geometry, the idea of congruent triangles. Two triangles are congruent if they have the same angles. In geometry, we may not care at all about the lengths of the sides, just the angles. In this case, we relate triangles with the same angles and treat them as the same triangle.  A relation that is reflexive, symmetric and transitive is an equivalence relation equivalence relation .   In we proved that the relation given by is an equivalence relation since we proved it is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.  In fact, the proof can easily be adapted to show is an equivalence relation for . The details are left as an exercise,  This relation is an important enough that it has its own definition.  Let . Then and are congruent modulo congruent mod if .  We often just say is congruent to mod , and denote it is congruent to mod ;  Congruence mod 3  True or false: .  Since , true.  True or false: .  Since , true.  True or false: .  Since , false.  True or false: .  Since , false.   Let be an equivalence relation on . Let . The set is the equivalence class equivalence class of .  Given a specific , we find the equivalence class of by finding all the elements that are related to . Keep in mind the equivalence class is a set, denoted . the equivalence class of  Equivalence Classes  Consider the equivalence relation , on .  Find , the set of elements in equivalent to 0.   Find , the set of elements in equivalent to 1.   Find , the set of elements in equivalent to 2.   Find , the set of elements in equivalent to 3.   Find , the set of elements in equivalent to -1.    We can notice a few things from this last example. We can see that some of our equivalence classes are the same. In particular, and . In fact, there are only three distinct equivalence classes, , any other equivalence class will equal one of these.  A few other things to notice, distinct equivalence classes are disjoint--they have no elements in common. Also, contains . We may also recognize that the equivalence classes partition the integers.  More Equivalence Classes  Consider the equivalence relation , on .  This is the relation where two subsets of are related if they have the same number of elements. You can check that this is an equivalence relation.  Find , the set of elements in equivalent to .  , since this is the only subset with 0 elements.  Find .  , since these all have 1 element.  Find .   Find .    Once again, the distinct equivalence classes are disjoint--they have no elements in common. Furthermore, the equivalence classes partition the power set by size of the subset.  Define the relation on by .  Prove is an equivalence relation.  Find and .  Recall that .  Prove the relation is an equivalence relation on .  Find and .  Let . Let .  Check the conditions in to show is a partition of .  Define the relation on ,  and are in the same subset of the partition. Draw the directed graph for .  Show is reflexive, symmetric and transitive.  Find , the equivalence class of 1.  Do you think this particular partition matters? Could we define this relation on any partition of any set and still have it be reflexive, symmetric and transitive?  There is an important connection between equivalence classes and partitions, as we see in the next two theorems.  Let be a set and an equivalence relation. The equivalence classes of form a partition of .  Conversely, as we saw in , if we have a partition of and define the relation and are in the same subset , then is an equivalence relation. We call this the equivalence relation induced by the partition.  Let be a set and be a partition of . Let be the relation induced by the partition. Then is an equivalence relation.  We leave the details of the proof of as an exercise.  The proof of follows directly from the next two Lemmas.  Let be an equivalence relation on and . If then .   Since we want to show the sets are equal, we will show are subsets of each other.  Show . Let . Then by defintion of equivalence class, . We assumed . By the transitive property, . Thus, .  Show . Let . Then by definition of equivalence class, . We assumed . By the symmetric property, . By the transitive property, . Thus, .   really says that if two elements are related in an equivalence relation, they must have the same equivalence class. You can check this with the above examples. Note, we needed the symmetric and transitive properties to prove this lemma.  Let be an equivalence relation on and . Either or .  Assume . We want to show . Since , there exists . This means and . By the symmetric property, . By the transitive property, since and , we have . By , .   really says that any two equivalence classes are either disjoint or exactly the same.  follows since, by the reflexive property, means every element is in an equivalence class. Thus, the union of the equivalence classes is all of . By distinct equivalence classes are disjoint. Thus, we have a partition of .

We will also introduce the concept of modular arithmetic.  Recall the definition for congruence mod , :  Let . Then congruent mod if .  Note, we can use , since , though defined, is not very interesting since 1 divides everything.  In some applications, and often in computer science, the remainder, , when is divided by is denoted . When using equals (=), we will mean the specific remainder. When using congruence ( ), we will mean the relation.

A familiar example is clock time. Suppose it is 11 am and you have an appointment in 3 hours. In general, you would not think of your appointment for 14 o'clock. You would think of noon as 0, and get that your appointment is at 2 o'clock. There are many more applications in algebra, cryptography, and computer science where we want to classify integers by their remainders mod .  The following theorem will be useful in proving statements involving congruence, but also in helping do calculations.  Let . The following statements are equivalent.   ;  ;  for some ;  and have the same remainder when divided by ;  , where here we refer to the remainder when dividing by .

Although we have seen congruence mod is an equivalence relation, we formally state it in the following theorem.  Congruence mod is an equivalence relation on with equivalence classes . Furthermore, .  For the proof, see .  Find the equivalence classes for congruence mod 5. List several elements of each equivalence class. What do the elements of each congruence class look like? Think about remainders.  Modular arithmetic modular arithmetic is just the process of adding, subtracting, and multiplying, where we treat integers with the same remainder mod , as equivalent. Thus, we can replace any integer with it's remainder.   Properties of Modular Arithmetic  If and , then     , for    Basically, we can do regular arithmetic, where we can reduce to remainders, or equivalence classes mod .  Modular Arithmetic  Use modular arithmetic to find  .  , so  .   .  , so   Find by first reducing 31 and 92 mod 5, then adding.  Find by first reducing 56 mod 5, then raising to 21.  We can write integers using their decimal expansion. For example, we can write 592 as a decimal expansion: .  Write 1526 as a similar expansion using powers of 10.  Find 10 mod 9 and mod 9 for any .  Use the decimal expansion and (b) find (592 mod 9) and (1526 mod 9).  If we are doing modular arithmetic we often work directly with the equivalence classes, rather than all of the integers.  We define , where represents the equivalence class . Although this sounds complicated, we just do regular arithmetic with and reduce to the remainder mod .

Finding Probability of an Event  A standard deck of playing cards has 52 cards. Each card has a suit and a value. The deck has four suits: hearts, diamonds, spades, clubs. Each suit has 13 values: Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King. The spades and clubs are called black cards, the hearts and diamonds are called red cards.

Suppose you toss a fair coin two times.  List all the possible outcomes.  What is the probability that you get exactly 2 heads?  What is the probability that you get exactly 1 head?  In order to calculate a probability, we need to be able to count equally-likely events. Just because there are, say, 3 outcomes, that doesn't mean all the outcomes are equally-likely. For example, the Linfied football team could win, lose, or tie a game. Given the team's winning streak, the three outcomes are not equally-likely. They have a much higher probability of winning than just 1\/3.  Thus, the focus for the rest of the chapter will be on counting events. Once we can count outcomes, it is straight-forward to find the probability.  Before moving on, though, we will state a few useful facts about probabilities.    is always a number between 0 and 1.

  "body": " Multiplication Rule multiplication rule  In this section we look at how to count a process that has several steps. We start with an example.  Coin Toss  Toss a coin three times. How many ways can you get exactly two heads in the three tosses?  First toss: H or T  Second toss: H or T  Third toss: H or T  If we think about what happens after the first toss, we have H or T. For each of those outcomes, we get H or T on the second toss, so we now have 4 outcomes: HH, HT, TH, TT  With the third toss, each of our four outcomes could end with H or T, giving us 8 outcomes: HHH, HTH, THH, TTH, HHT, HTT, THT, TTT.  Out of these 8 possible outcomes, there are 3 outcomes with exactly 2 heads: HTH, THH, HHT.  We can also see the possibilies using a possibility tree , where the first (top) level represents the first toss, the second level, the second toss, and the third level, the third toss. The blue paths show the outcomes with exactly two Heads.   Possibility tree for tossing a coin three times      In , we saw that each toss doubled the number of outcomes from the previous toss. For example, if we tossed the coin 4 times, we would have outcomes. We are using the multiplication rule to determine the number of outcomes.   Multiplication Rule  Supose we have a process with steps, where  the first step can be done in ways;  the second step can be done in ways;  the step can be done in ways.  Then the total operation can be done in ways.   Suppose a restaurant offers 3 appetizers, 3 entrees, and 2 desserts.  Draw a possibility tree for how many different meals (one appetizer, one entree, and one dessert) you can create.  How many total meals can you create?  Multiplication Rule: License Plates  Find the number of license plates that can be made if each one consists of two letters from A through E, followed by four digits from 1 through 9.  There are 5 choices for the letters: A, B, C, D, E.  There are 9 choices for the digits: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.  First choose a letter, then another letter, then choose each of the numbers. We can use the multiplication rule since we can choose each character as a process.  Thus, we have license plates.  Now, suppose you cannot repeat a number in any one license plate. How many license plates can we make?  When choosing the numbers, first we have 9 choices, then 8, since we can't choose the same number as the first digit, etc.  The total number of license plates if we can't repeat a number is .   Suppose a license plate consists of 3 letters followed by 2 digits.  How many license plates can you make?  How many license plates can you make if you cannot repeat a letter or number?

Permutations of a Set  Let . Then a permutation of is a list of elements in . List all the permutations of .  Since we have 3 choices for our first element, then 2 choices for the second, and 1 for the last, there are permutations.  The permutations are abc, acb, bca, bac, cab, cba.  How many permutations are there of the set ?    List all the permutations of . There are 6.  How many permutations are there of a set with 5 elements?  How many permutations are there of a set with elements?  gives us a formula for finding the number of permutations of a set with elements.  The number of permutations of a set with elements is factorial, .  An -permutation -permutation of a set is an ordered selection of elements taken from the elements of in a row. We use the notation the number of -permutations from a set of elements for the number of -permutations from a set of elements.  -Permutations of a Set  Let . Then a 3-permutation of is a list of 3 (non-repeating) elements from . For example, ace, dbe, bda are all 3-permutations.  Find the number of 3-permutations of , .  We have 5 choices for the first letter, 4 choices for the second, and 3 choices for the last. Thus, .  How many 4-permutations are there of the standard English alphabet?    How many 2-permutations are there of ?  How many 3-permutations are there of ? Think of finding a way to count them using the multiplication rule rather than writing them all down.  Try to find a general formula for counting all -permutations in a set of elements.  gives us a formula for finding the number of -permutations of a set with elements.  The number of -permutations of a set with elements is which is often easier to calculate using  Find .  Finding Four-Digit Integers  How many odd integers are there from 1000 to 9999?  The number is a string of 4 digits. The first digit cannot be 0, so there are 9 choices: 1 through 9. The second and third digits can be anything from 0 to 9, so there are 10 choices for each. The last digit must be odd, so the only choices are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.  Thus, there are odd numbers.  How many integers are there from 1000 to 9999 that have distict digits?  The first digit cannot be 0, so there are 9 choices: 1 through 9. The second digit can be anything from 0 to 9, except for whatever the first digit is, so there are 9 choices. Similarly, there are 8 choices for the third digit, and 7 for the last digit.  Thus, there are numbers with distinct digits.    Check Your Understanding  Toss a coin 4 times.

Addition Rule addition rule  If is the union of distinct, mutually disjoint sets, , then the number of elements in is given by   Addition Rule: Counting Numbers Divisible by 5  How many 3 digit numbers are divisible by 5?  We were able to count 3 digit numbers in the last section by constructing the number as a sequence of digits. We will use this example to think about how to count these as disjoint sets.  Let be the set of 3 digit numbers ending in 5.  Let be the set of 3 digit numbers ending in 0.  , where we are using the multiplication rule as in .  .  Since no number ends in both 5 and 0, . Thus, by the addition rule,   How many 3 digit numbers are divisible by 10?  How many 3 digit numbers are divisible by 2?  It is going to take practice to be able to see when to use the multiplication rule and when to use the addition rule. If you are counting elements of different sets, use addition. If you are counting elements that are constructed in a process (can you determine step 1, step 2, etc?), then use the multiplication rule. Many problems require both rules, as we saw in .  Now we want to look at what happens if our sets are not disjoint.  If is finite and , then .  If we want to count the number of elements in , we can count those in and those in . But every element in the intersection has now been counted twice. so we need to subtract . This is the idea behind the Inclusion-Exclusion Rule.  Inclusion-Exclusion Rule inclusion-exclusion rule Let be finite sets.   For the case with three sets, we can see that each element in the intersection of at least two sets got counted twice, but when we subtract off all three intersections, we end up subtracting each element in more than one intersection twice, so we need to add back the elements in the intersection of all three sets. For this class, we won't need to use Inclusion-Exclusion on more than three sets, but the rule does generalize to sets by adding the sets, subtracting intersections of two sets, adding the intersections of three sets, subtracting the intersections of four sets, etc.  Inclusion-Exclusion: Counting Multiples  How many integers from 1 to 1000 are multiples of 3 or multiples of 5?  Let be the set of multiples of 3. Let be the set of multiples of 5.  Then is the set of multiples of 3 and 5, so multiples of 15.  We need a good way to count the multiples of 3. We know they have the form . Since , we have that . Hence, . Since , . Thus,  Similarly, since , Since ,  By Inclusion-Exclusion,   We want to count the number of integers from 1-50 that are divisible by 3 or 7.   How many integers from 1-50 are divisible by 3?  How many integers from 1-50 are divisible by 7?  What is the number of integers from 1-50 divisible by 3 or 7? You can pretty easily check you answer by writing them all down. Can you use inclusion-exclusion to calculate this?   We want to count the number of integers from 1-1000 that are divisible by 4, 7 or 9.  How many integers from 1-1000 are divisible by 4?  How many integers from 1-1000 are divisible by 7?  How many integers from 1-1000 are divisible by 9?  Now calculate the number of integers 1-1000 divisible by 4, 7, or 9 using inclusion-exclusion. What other sets do you need to calculate? You'll need the 3 set version of Inclusion-Exclusion  How many ways can the word THEORY be arranged if the TH must be next to each other as TH or HT? Count the TH words, then the HT words, then figure out which rule you need to find the total.  Inclusion-Exclusion: Drug Study  Suppose a study was done with three drugs, A, B and C. A total of 50 subjects used all three drugs. They reported which drugs made them feel better, with the following results:  21 felt better with A  21 felt better with B  31 felt better with C  9 felt better with A and B  14 felt better with A and C  15 felt better with B and C  41 felt better with at least one drug  Some of the subjects who had relief from, say, A, might also have had relief from another drug. So some of the 21 who reported feeling better with A, may also be included in the count of the 9 who felt better with A and B.  How many had relief from none of the drugs?   How many had relief from all three of the drugs?  We need to calculate , which we can find by rewriting the Inclusion-Exclusion Rule:     Check Your Understanding  How many 3 digit numbers begin with 1 or begin with a 2?     Correct, .

A college conducted a survey to explore the academic interests and achievements of its students. It asked students to place checks beside the numbers of all statements that were true of them. Statement #1 was I was on the honor roll last term. Statement #2 was I belong to an academic club. Statement #3 was I am majoring in at least two subjects. Out of a sample of 100 students, 28 checked #1, 26 checked #2, and 14 checked #3, 18 checked both #1 and #2, 4 checked both #1 and #3, 3 checked both #2 and #3, and 2 checked all three. Note that some of the students who checked #1 (or #2 or #3) may have also checked other numbers.    How many of the students checked at least one of the statements?    How many students checked none of the statements?    How many students checked #1 and #2, but not #3?    How many students checked #2 and #3, but not #1?

  "title": "Pigeonhole Principle",
  "body": " Pigeonhole Principle pigeonhole principle  In this section we look at a method of counting that uses a correspondence between two sets. We can think of one set as a set of objects and the other as a set of boxes. The name of the principle comes from thinking of a set of letters and pigeonholes, which is what they used to call rows of letterboxes. Though it is also fun to think about correspondences between pigeons and pigeonholes.  Pigeonhole Principle pigeonhole principle A function from one fnite set to a smaller finite set cannot be one-to-one. There must be at least two elements in the domain that have the same image in the codomain.  The Pigeonhole Principle really just says that if there are more objects (pigeons) than boxes (pigeonholes) then there must be at least one box with more than one object.  When working with pigeonhole problems  identify the objects (pigeons)  identify the boxes (pigeonholes)  show the number of objects is bigger than the number of boxes.   Beware:  You can still have a box with no objects.  You do not know which box has more than one object.  A box could have all the objects.  You do not know how many objects are in any particular box.   Counting Socks  In a drawer with 5 pairs of red socks and 5 pairs of blue socks, how many socks do you need to randomly pull out of the drawer to be certain that you have a pair?  Note, there are 10 socks of each color.  3 socks, since the first two might be different colors. If that happens the third sock must match one of the first two.  In this example, the socks are the objects and the colors are the boxes.  Now, what if you need to make sure you have a red pair?  12 socks.   It is important to note that pigeonhole problems are not about probability. We want to know when we are guaranteed to have a pair of socks, not when it is likely that we have a pair.  In a group of 10 people, must 2 be born in the same month? What is the most people that can be born in the same month?  In a group of 13 people, must at least 2 be born in the same month? Must at least one person be born in January?  Finding Sums of Integers  Let . How many integers do you need to choose from to guarantee that 2 numbers will sum to 11?  Since we are looking for sums of 11, our boxes can be pairs of numbers that sum to 11: . Then our objects are the numbers themselves. We need the number of numbers to be greater than the number of boxes, which is 5. Thus, if we choose 6 numbers from , we are guaranteed to have 2 from the same subset. This means with 6 numbers we must have two numbers that sum to 11.  Let . If 5 integers are selected from , must at least one pair have a sum of 9? If 4 integers are selected from , must at least one pair have a sum of 9?  How many integers from 0 to 60 must you choose in order to get at least one that is odd? How many integers from 0 to 60 must you choose in order to get at least one that is even?  We can generalize the Pigeonhole Principle. If we have enough objects, we can guarantee more than two objects in one box.  Generalized Pigeonhole Principle pigeonhole principle generalized If there are objects mapped to boxes, and for some , we have , then at least one box contains or more objects.  Generalized Pigeonhole  Suppose you have 23 books that are placed in 4 boxes.  Must at least one box contain at least one book?  Yes  Must at least one box contain at least two books?  Yes  Must at least one box contain at least six books?  Yes  Must at least one box contain at least seven books?  No  What is the most books that can be in a box?  23  What is the fewest books that can be in a box?  0   If you have 8 books and want to place them in 3 boxes, must at least one box have 4 books? Must at least one box have 3 books?  In a group of 2000 people, must 5 have the same birthday?  Let be finite sets with the same number of elements. Suppose is a function from to . Then is one-to-one if and only if is onto.  The Pigeonhole Principle can be used to prove the theorem, but it is more technical than we need. If you try a few examples of functions from a set of elements to another set of elements, you can probably convince yourself that a one-to-one function must be onto and vice versa.   Check Your Understanding  What is the fewest number of digits you need to randomly select from to guarantee you have either two even or two odd numbers?     Correct.      Incorrect. With two numbers, one could be even, one could be odd.      Incorrect. Think about the boxes being Even\/Odd. As you select numbers, at what point must you have two in the Even box or two in the Odd box?     3  What is the fewest number of digits you need to randomly select from to guarantee you have two even numbers?

As you select numbers, at what point must you have two in the same set?     4  If you randomly select 4 digits from are you guaranteed to have two with remainder 0 when divided by 3?   Yes  For example, you could have selected 1, 2, 4, 5, none of which have remainder 0.    No  Correct. Now think about how many you would have to select to get 2 with remainder 0.   No     Consider a standard deck of 52 cards.    If 13 cards are selected from he deck, must at least 2 be of the same denomination?

If six integers are selected from , must at least one pair have a sum of 15? Why?    If integers are chosen from the set , where is a positive integer, must at least one of them be even? Why?

  "body": " Combinations combination  In this section we look at how to count subsets of a set and define the mathematical concept of a combination.  Let be nonnegative integers with . An -combination combination of a set of elements is the number of subsets of size that can be chosen from a set of elements. We denote it , which is read choose . choose  Other common notation are , or . We will use notation, which we first saw in . For example, is the number of subsets of size 4 chosen from a set of 5 elements.  Since order does not matter in a set, the order in which we choose elements of a set does not matter. Recall, when counting permutations, the order in which we chose our elements did matter. We can use what we know about permutations, though, to count combinations.  We can calculate combinations by first finding all the -permuatations of a set, then dividing by all the possible orderings of that subset: . This can be rewritten to be the standard formula for calculating combinations: .  Note, since , and . This also makes sense with the definition, as there is only one set with 0 elements, the empty set.  Calculate and .  Calculate and .  Combinations versus Permutations  Suppose you want to choose a group of 3 students in a class of 15 for a group project. How many ways can you choose the group?  We use combinations: . It does not matter if a member was chosen first, second, or third, they would still be a member of the group. Thus, there are ways to choose a group of 3.  Now suppose you want to choose a group of 3 students in a class of 15 for a group project, but the first student chosen will be the note-taker, the second will be the presenter, the third will manage the discussion. How many ways can you choose the group?  We use permutations: . Now it does matter if a member was chosen first, second, or third, as each member has a different role. Thus, there are ways to choose a group of 3 where the members' roles are defined.   In deciding whether to use combinations or permutations, you need to decide whether order matters. For combinations, order doesn't matter; think about choosing subsets. For permuations, order does matter; think about choosing ordered lists.  Recall, a binary string is just a list of 0s and 1s  Binary Strings How many binary strings of length 5 can have exactly 2 ones?  We can think of forming a binary string with 2 ones as a list of 5 places where we need to choose 2 places for the ones. Once we've done that, the other places must have 0's. Thus, we have five places and choose 2:  How many binary strings of length 5 can have at most 2 ones?  Here we can count the strings with 2 ones, 1 one, and 0 ones. We add them since the strings with different numbers of ones are disjoint:   How many binary strings of length 7 have exactly 3 ones? Think of this as a list of 7 digits. How many ways are there to place the ones?  How many binary strings of length 7 have at most 2 ones? First count how many have 0 ones, then 1 one, then 2 ones. Should you use the addition rule or multiplication rule to find the total number?  Rearranging Letters How many ways are there to order the letters in the word letter ?  We can think of the string of letters as 6 places where we can choose to put letters. First we can choose the place to put the l : we have 6 places, we need to choose 1:  Next we choose the places to put the two e s: we now only have 5 places (since one has the l), we need to choose 2:  We continue in this way, with 3 places to put the two t s: , and one remaining place to put the r : .  Since placing each letter is a process (we don't have a complete string until we have placed all the letters), we need to use the multiplication rule:   There is another way to calculate the previous example.  Alternate Rearranging Letters How many ways are there to order the letters in the word letter ?  We can think of the string of letters as 6 places where we can choose to put letters. First we can think of all the letters as distinct. Then we have 6 letters to choose for the first place, 5 for the second, 4 for the third, etc. Thus we have ways to place 6 distinct letters.  But the letters are not distinct, so we need to divide by the number of ways we over-counted. For each permutation we just counted, switching the two e s gives us the same word, so we need to divide by the number of ways to rearrange the two e s: Similarly, we need to divide by equivalent arrangements of the two t s: .

  "body": " Binomial Theorem Binomial Theorem  The Binomial Theorem has applications in many areas of mathematics, from calculus, to number theory, to probability. In this section we look at some examples of combinatorial proofs using binomial coefficients and ultimately prove the Binomial Theorem using induction.  Let be nonnegative integers with . Then  An algebraic proof is straightforward and left as an exercise (see ). We will give a combinatorial proof. This means we will prove the two sides of the equation are equal by showing that they are two different ways to count the same set. In general, a combinatorial proof is done by giving a counting argument.  By definition, is the number of subsets where we choose objects from objects.  We can create a set of objects by specifying which objects are in the set or by specifying which objects are not in the set. We note that there are objects not in the set. Thus, counts the ways to find a set of objects out of objects by finding the ways to not include objects. Thus, both and count subsets of objects from , one by counting the objects in the set, one by counting the objects not in the set.  Pascal's Formula Pascal's Formula Let be nonnegative integers with . Then  We leave the algebraic proof as an exercise (see ), and instead provide a combinatorial proof.  By definition, counts the subsets of objects chosen from objects.  Let , a set of objects. We can create all the subsets of objects by choosing all objects from or by choosing out of and including . Thus, we can count the subsets of objects from objects with .   Give an algebraic proof for Pascal's Formula: Start with the right-hand side. Use the definition of choose, then find a common denominator. Note, you will save yourself a lot of work if you find the least common denominator.  We often call terms of the form  binomial coefficients binomial coefficient .  There is a connection between binomial coefficients and Pascal's Triangle.  You may have seen Pascal's Triangle before, the start of which is  1  1 1  1 2 1  1 3 3 1   We get each number in a row by adding the two numbers above. If there is only one number, you just get 1. For example, the fourth row is 1, 3, 3, 1, since . The next row would be 1, 4, 6, 4, 1.  If we think about the first row as actually being the 0th row, we can make a triangle with the binomial coefficients:       If you calculate the binomial coefficients, you will see that you get the same values as Pascal's Triangle. Furthermore, Pascal's Formula is just the rule we use to get the triangle: add the and terms from the row to get the term in the row.  A binomial binomial is an expression of the form .  The Binomial Theorem gives a formula for calculating . We can prove the Binomial Theorem combinatorially or algebraically. We will provide the algebraic proof, which is a proof by induction. Although we do not provide the details of the combinatorial proof, the next example should give some insight into the combinatorial argument.  A Combinatorial Calculation for  Suppose we want to expand (or multiply) . We can think of the multiplication in this way,  there is 1 way to get : choose 0 's from the three factors.  there are 3 ways to get : choose 1 from the three factors.  there are 3 ways to get : choose 2 's' from the three factors.  there is 1 way to get : choose 3 's from the three factors.  This give us    can be generalized to in the Binomial Theorem.  Binomial Theorem Binomial Theorem Let be a nonnegative integer, then  Prove by induction on .  Base step: Let . Then . Also,  Induction step: Assume .  Show   Now we want to change the index of the second sum. This is just a substitution of variable that allows us to shift how we index the terms. If we were to write out the sum, rather than have it in summation notation, we would not need this step. But it allows us to easily combine like terms in the two summations. So, in the second sum, let , so when ; when , and . We get   Show the Binomial Theorem holds for and .  The Binomial Theorem relates a sum to a power of a binomial. Although we often think of using the Binomial Theorem as a way to calculate the coefficients for expanding , it can also be used to simplify certain sums. In this case, the power of the binomial is the closed form closed form sum sum closed form .  Expressing a Sum in Closed Form  Express the sum, , in closed form.  For problems such as this, we need to identify and as in the Binomial Theorem.  We can see that , since the power of matches the power of .

A graph graph is a collection of vertices vertex and edges edge .   Example of a graph,     is an example of a graph. We have labeled the vertices with and the edges with .    A graph, , consists of a finite set, , of vertices vertex and a finite set, , of edges edge . Each edge is assocated with two vertices (it may be the same vertex) called endpoints endpoints of an edge .  In the above example, , . The endpoints of edge are .  If two edges have the same endpoints, we say they are parallel parallel edges edge parallel .  A loop loop is an edge where both endpoints are the same vertex.  Two vertices connected by an edge are called adjacent adjacent vertices vertex adjacent . For example, in  is adjacent to , but is not adjacent to .  A vertex of a loop is adjacent to itself.  An edge is incident on incident edge each of its endpoints.  Two edges that are incident on the same vertex are adjacent adjacent edges edge adjacent . For example, in  and are adjacent, but and are not adjacent.  An isolated vertex isolated vertex is one with no incident edges.  A graph with no vertices is the empty graph empty graph .  In , edges and are parallel edges, while edge is a loop. We also have an isolated vertex, .

No.   It is important to note that it is possible to draw the same graph in different ways.   The same graph drawn in two different ways     The two graphs in are the same graph since they have the same vertex and edge sets, and a given edge still has the same endpoints.  A directed graph directed graph or digraph digraph graph directed consists of a set of vertices, and directed edges (arrows), , where each edge is associated with an ordered pair of of vertices called endpoints, .  We saw directed graphs in and . For example, see . In this example, we have an edge with endpoints , but not .  Really, the vertices of a graph represent a set, while the edges represent relationships between elements of that set. There are lots of examples of graphs as representations of relationships or networks. For example, graphs are used to represent communications systems, flight patterns, and friendship networks. Graphs can even be used to find strategies in games such as sudoku.  A graph with no parallel edges or loops is called simple simple graph . For example, is simple, while is not.  Now we want to define a couple special graphs.  A complete graph on vertices complete graph graph complete , , is a simple graph with vertices whose set of edges contains exactly one edge for every pair of vertices.  are given in the following figure.   Examples of complete graphs     Draw the complete graphs on 5 vertices and 6 vertices, and .   Let .

As you might have seen in , there is a relationship between the total degree of a graph and the number of edges.  The total degree of a graph is where is the number of edges in .  We will not provide a formal proof, but the theorem is not hard to show as each edge must be incident on two vertices. Thus, each edge is counted twice in the total degree.  Draw any graph with 6 edges. Find the total degree of your graph. Verify that the total degree is twice the number of edges.  The total degree of any graph is even.

  "body": " Paths and Circuits path circuit graph path graph circuit  The origin story for this section is the Konigsberg Bridge Problem, which involves seven bridges, as pictured in . The story is that the challenge of Konigsberg was to try to traverse all the bridges, without repeating one, and return to where you started. Euler found a way to represent the problem as a graph, also pictured. The vertices are the land masses and the edges are the bridges. This representation makes it easier to try to answer the question. Before moving on, try to solve the bridge problem by finding a route through the graph that starts and ends at some vertex and traverses each edge exactly once.   Konigsberg bridge problem,    For each of the following terms we have a list of vertices and edges, , that represent a way to traverse through the graph. So, for example, must be an endpoint of , must be an endpoint of and , etc. For each of the following terms we indicate whether we can repeat vertices and\/or edges in the list.  A walk walk from to has . It can repeat edges and vertices. It can begin at any vertex and end at any vertex.  A trail trail from to has . It cannot repeat edges. It can begin at any vertex and end at any vertex.  A path path from to has . It cannot repeat edges or vertices. It can begin at any vertex and end at any vertex.  A closed walk closed walk walk closed must start and end at the same vertex , . It can repeat edges and vertices.  A circuit circuit must start and end at the same vertex , . It cannot repeat edges. It can repeat vertices.  A simple circuit simple circuit circuit simple must start and end at the same vertex , . It cannot repeat edges or vertices, except for the initial and terminal vertex.    If it is clear which vertices we must use, we often just use the edges, , to describe paths, curcuits, walks, etc.  The trivial walk walk trivial is just the single vertex . This is also the trivial circuit circuit trivial .  Paths and Circuits  Consider the graph .

The example in with the isolated vertex, is an example of a graph that is not connected.  We state several propositions in this section without proof. You are encouraged to sketch examples of graphs to try to verify the propositions for yourself.  If is a connected graph then any two distinct vertices of can be connected by a simple path.  Draw several examples of connected graphs. Verify for yourself that if is connected then any two distinct vertices of can be connected by a simple path.  If and are part of a circuit in and one edge is removed, then there still exists a path from to in .  Draw several examples of graphs with a circuit. Verify for yourself that if and are part of a circuit and one edge is removed then there still exists a path from to in .  If is a connected graph and contains a nontrivial circuit, then an edge of the circuit can be removed without disconnecting .  Draw several examples of connected graphs containing a nontrivial circuit. Verify for yourself that if is connected and contains a nontrivial circuit then an edge of the circuit can be removed without disconnecting .  An Euler circuit Euler circuit circuit Euler for a graph is a circuit that contains every vertex and every edge of .  An Euler circuit must start and end at the same vertex and include every vertex and every edge. It can repeat vertices, but it cannot repeat edges. If you look back at the Konigsberg bridge problem, you can see that to solve the bridge problem is to find an Euler circuit for the associated graph. Were you able to find such a circuit?  Finding Euler Circuits  Is it possible to find an Euler circuit for the graph in ?      Yes. For example .  Is it possible to find an Euler circuit for the Konigsberg bridge graph in ?      No.   Draw the complete bipartite graphs , , and . Determine if each of these graphs has an Euler circuit.  We want to decide when a graph has an Euler circuit. The following two theorems completely characterize when a graph has an Euler circuit.  If a graph has an Euler circuit, then every vertex has even degree.  Although we will not prove this formally, the basic idea is that to create an Euler circuit for each vertex you need to be able to arrive at the vertex along an edge and then leave the vertex along a different edge. In the case of the inital vertex, you need to be able to leave the vertex and then return.  tells us that the Konigsberg bridge graph cannot have an Euler circuit since we have vertices of odd degree.  If every vertex of a nonempty graph has even degree and is connected, then the graph has an Euler circuit.  tells us that the graph in has an Euler circuit since all vertices have even degree, and the graph is connected. The graph in does not have an Euler circuit since it is not connected (although every vertex has even degree).  Verify and on , , and .  An Euler path Euler path from to is a sequence of adjacent edges and vertices that starts at and ends at passing through every vertex of at least once and traversing every edge exactly once.  An Euler path is a path that covers every edge and vertex of without repeating edges.  A graph has an Euler path from to if and only if is connected, and have odd degree, and all other vertices of have even degree.  Draw a graph that has an Euler path but not an Euler circuit.  We've been focusing on traversing a graph by covering each edge exactly once, but what if we want to traverse each vertex exactly once?  A Hamiltonian circuit Hamiltonian circuit circuit Hamiltonian for is a simple circuit that includes every vertex of .  A Hamiltonian circuit starts and ends at the same vertex, passes through all other vertices without repeating, does not repeat edges, but does not need to use all the edges. For example, in the Konigsberg bridge graph , we have Hamiltonian circuit .  Draw the complete bipartite graphs , , and . Determine if these graphs have an Hamiltonian circuit.

  "title": "Trees",
  "body": " Trees tree graph tree  In this section we look at a special type of graph called a tree. Trees are useful in many applications, such as probability trees or decision trees.  A graph is circuit-free circuit-free graph graph circuit-free if it has no nontrivial circuits.  A graph is a tree tree if it is connected and circuit-free.  The trivial tree is just a single vertex. While the empty tree has no vertices (and, hence, no edges).  A graph is a forest forest if it is circuit-free. We can think of a forest as a collection of trees.  Trees and Not Trees    Examples of trees      Examples of graphs that are not trees      A terminal vertex terminal vertex or leaf leaf is a vertex of degree 1. Vertices of degree greater than 1 are internal internal vertex or branch branch vertex vertex branch vertices.  We now define some special types of trees, and related terms.  A rooted tree has one vertex, , designated as the root rooted tree tree rooted .  The level level of vertex vertex level of a vertex, , is the number of edges from to the root, .  The height height of a tree tree height of a tree is the maximum level of the tree.  Let be a vertex in a rooted tree. Then the children child of a vertex vertex child of are the vertices adjacent to , one level below (think of the root at the top of the tree, with each successive level below the previous one).  The parent parent of a vertex vertex parent of a vertex is the adjacent vertex one level up from .  The siblings sibling of a vertex vertex sibling of a vertex are the vertices with the same parent as .  The ancestors ancestor of a vertex vertex ancestor of a vertex are the vertices on the path from to , not including .  The descendants descendant of a vertex vertex descendant of a vertex are the vertices on the subtree taking as the root, not including .   Rooted Tree    A rooted tree     In the example, let be the root of the tree.  Then is at level 2, is at level 4, and is at level 0.  The height of the tree is 4.  The children of are and .  The only sibling of is ; the parent of is .  The ancestors of are and . The descendants of are .    A binary tree binary tree is a rooted tree in which each vertex has at most two children.  A full binary tree binary tree full is a rooted tree in which each branch vertex has exactly two children and all leaves are at the same height.  Full Binary Tree    A full binary tree of height 3      Draw the full binary tree of height 4. How many leaves does it have?  In this activity we will explore the relationship between the number of edges and the number of vertices in a tree.  Draw a forest with 10 vertices that is not a tree.  Draw three different trees, each with 10 vertices.  How many edges does each graph in (b) have? Check with other students on the class. How many edges do their graphs have?  Draw a tree with 5 vertices and one with 12 vertices. How many edges do they have?  Can you draw a tree with 5 vertices with 7 edges? What about 5 edges? What is the most number of edges you can have? What is the fewest?  Form a conjecture about how many edges a tree with 10 vertices has. What about a tree with 5 vertices?    After experimenting you should be able to conjecture that a tree with 10 vertices has 9 edges, and a tree with 5 vertices must have 4 edges. This relationship is true in general.  For any positive integer, , any tree with vertices has edges.  In this activity we explore graphs with edges and edges more generally.  Draw a graph with 7 vertices and 6 edges that is not a tree.  Draw a connected graph with 7 vertices and 6 edges that is not a tree.  Draw a graph with 7 vertices and 6 edges that is not connected and is not a tree.  Do you think any of the tasks in (a), (b), and (c) are impossible?  Form a conjecture about graphs with vertices and edges.   We should be able to see that it is not possible to draw a connected graph with 7 vertices and 6 edges that is not a tree. This leads to the next theorem.  For any positive integer , if a graph, , is connected with vertices and edges, then is a tree.   Check Your Understanding  For which values of is the complete graph a tree?               No values of    All values of .   Just .  True or false: In a rooted tree, a vertex can have more than one parent. False.  True or false: In a rooted tree, a vertex can have 0 parents. The root has 0 parents. True, the root has 0 parents.  In the rooted tree in , how many children does have?     Correct.      Incorrect.

See .     1  How many leaves does the full binary tree of height 4 have?     Correct.      Incorrect. See , and draw a full binary tree of height 4.     16  True or false: There exists a tree with 7 vertices and 9 edges. False.  True or false: There exists a tree with 7 vertices and 5 edges. False.  True or false: There exists a forest with 7 vertices and 5 edges. True.  True or false: If a graph has 8 vertices and 7 edges it must be a tree. False.  True or false: If a connected graph has 8 vertices and 7 edges it must be a tree. True.  True or false: There exists a tree with 8 vertices and 2 leaves. True.  True or false: There exists a tree with 8 vertices and 7 leaves. True.    What is the total degree of a tree with vertices? Why?  Consider the following lemma.  Any tree with more than one vertex has at least one vertex of degree 1.  This is a useful lemma for proving statements about trees. However, if the tree has infinitely many vertices and edges, then the lemma is false. Give an example of an infinite tree that has no vertex of degree 1.    For each of the following, either draw a graph with the given properties or explain why no such graph exists.    Tree, nine vertices, nine edges.    Graph, connected, nine vertices, nine edges.    Tree, five vertices, total degree 8    Graph, six vertices, five edges, not a tree.    Graph, connected, ten vertices, nine edges, has a circuit.      Suppose a connected graph has twelve vertices and 11 edges. Must this graph have a vertex of degree 1? Explain your answer.    "

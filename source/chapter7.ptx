  <title>Functions</title>
  <introduction>
   
    <p>
      In this chapter we revisit functions. We will look at functions as more than just maps of real numbers. We will also study the properties of one-to-one and onto, as these properties are central to understanding maps and relationships between objects in many areas of mathematics.

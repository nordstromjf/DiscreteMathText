  <p>Let <m>S</m> be a set of possible outcomes, called a <term>sample space</term>. Let <m>E</m> be a subset of <m>S</m> with some property. We call <m>E</m> an <term>event</term>.</p>

  <p>The <term>probability</term> of event <m>E</m>, <m>P(E)</m>, is the number of outcomes in <m>E</m> divided by the total number of outcomes in <m>S</m>.</p>

  <p>Let <m>N(E)</m> be the number of elements in <m>E</m>. Similarly, <m>N(S)</m>, is the number of outcomes in <m>S</m>.</p>

  <p>In notation, <m>P(E)=\frac{N(E)}{N(S)}</m>.</p>

  <example xml:id="E_probcards"><title>Finding Probability of an Event</title>
    <p>A standard deck of playing cards has 52 cards. Each card has a suit and a value. The deck has four suits: hearts, diamonds, spades, clubs. Each suit has 13 values: Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King. The spades and clubs are called <q>black</q> cards, the hearts and diamonds are called <q>red</q> cards.</p>

    <p>Find the probability you randomly choose a club from the deck.</p>
    <p>Note, <m>E</m> is the set of clubs, <m>S</m> is the set of cards.</p>
    <answer><m>P(E)=\frac{13}{52}=\frac{1}{4}</m></answer>

    <p>Find the probability you randomly choose a red card from the deck.</p>
    <p>Note, <m>E</m> is the set of hearts and diamonds, <m>S</m> is the set of cards.</p>
    <answer><m>P(E)=\frac{26}{52}=\frac{1}{2}</m></answer>

    <p>Find the probability you randomly choose a 2 from the deck.</p>
    <p>Note, <m>E</m> is the set of 2's, <m>S</m> is the set of cards.</p>
    <answer><m>P(E)=\frac{4}{52}=\frac{1}{13}</m></answer>

<activity><introduction><p>Suppose you toss a fair coin two times.</p></introduction>
<task><p>List all the possible outcomes.</p></task>
<task><p>What is the probability that you get exactly 2 heads?</p></task>
<task><p>What is the probability that you get exactly 1 head?</p></task></activity>

<p>In order to calculate a probability, we need to be able to count <term>equally-likely</term> events. Just because there are, say, 3 outcomes, that doesn't mean all the outcomes are equally-likely. For example, the Linfied football team could win, lose, or tie a game. Given the team's winning streak, the three outcomes are not equally-likely. They have a much higher probability of winning than just 1/3.</p>

<p>Thus, the focus for the rest of the chapter will be on counting events. Once we can count outcomes, it is straight-forward to find the probability.</p>

<p>Before moving on, though, we will state a few useful facts about probabilities.</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li><m>P(E)</m> is always a number between 0 and 1. The probability can be 0.5. It cannot be 50%</li>
    <li><m>P(E)=0</m> means the event is not possible.</li>
    <li><m>P(E)=1</m> means the event always happens.</li>
  </ul>

  <title>Logic</title>
  <introduction>
   
    <p>
      In order to understand mathematical structure and form, we need to build a foundation in logic. Logical structure will give us a framework for understanding mathematical statements. We can then connect mathematical statements into the form of an argument. This allows us to understand the structure of mathematical proofs.

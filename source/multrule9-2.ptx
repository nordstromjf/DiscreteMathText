  <title>Multiplication Rule</title><idx>multiplication rule</idx>

  <p>In this section we look at how to count a process that has several steps. We start with an example.</p>

  <example xml:id="E_cointosscount"><title>Coin Toss</title>
    <p>Toss a coin three times. How many ways can you get exactly two heads in the three tosses?</p>
    <p>First toss: H or T</p>
    <p>Second toss: H or T</p>
    <p>Third toss: H or T</p>
    <p>If we think about what happens after the first toss, we have H or T. For each of those outcomes, we get H or T on the second toss, so we now have 4 outcomes: HH, HT, TH, TT</p>
    <p>With the third toss, each of our four outcomes could end with H or T, giving us 8 outcomes: HHH, HTH, THH, TTH, HHT, HTT, THT, TTT.</p>
    <p>Out of these 8 possible outcomes, there are 3 outcomes with exactly 2 heads: HTH, THH, HHT.</p>

    <p>We can also see the possibilies using a <term>possibility tree</term>, where the first (top) level represents the first toss, the second level, the second toss, and the third level, the third toss. The blue <q>paths</q> show the outcomes with exactly two Heads.</p>

  <p>In <xref ref="E_cointosscount" />, we saw that each toss doubled the number of outcomes from the previous toss. For example, if we tossed the coin 4 times, we would have <m>2^4=16</m> outcomes. We are using the multiplication rule to determine the number of outcomes.</p>

  <p>Supose we have a process with <m>k</m> steps, where
  <ul>
    <li>the first step can be done in <m>n_1</m> ways;</li>

  <example xml:id="E_licenseplates1"><title>Multiplication Rule: License Plates</title>
    <p>Find the number of license plates that can be made if each one consists of two letters from A through E, followed by four digits from 1 through 9.</p>
    <p>There are 5 choices for the letters: A, B, C, D, E.</p>
    <p>There are 9 choices for the digits: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.</p>

    <p>First choose a letter, then another letter, then choose each of the numbers. We can use the multiplication rule since we can choose each character as a process.</p>

    <p>Thus, we have <m>5\cdot 5\cdot 9\cdot 9\cdot 9\cdot 9=164025</m> license plates.</p>

    <p>Now, suppose you cannot repeat a number in any one license plate. How many license plates can we make?</p>

    <p>When choosing the numbers, first we have 9 choices, then 8, since we can't choose the same number as the first digit, etc.</p>
    <p>The total number of license plates if we can't repeat a number is <m>5\cdot 5\cdot 9\cdot 8\cdot 7\cdot 6=75600</m>.</p>

    <example xml:id="E_numberofintegers"><title>Finding Four-Digit Integers</title>
    <p>How many odd integers are there from 1000 to 9999?</p>
    <p>The number is a string of 4 digits. The first digit cannot be 0, so there are 9 choices: 1 through 9. The second and third digits can be anything from 0 to 9, so there are 10 choices for each. The last digit must be odd, so the only choices are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9.</p>

    <p>Thus, there are <m>(9)(10)(10)(5)=4500</m> odd numbers.</p>

    <p>How many integers are there from 1000 to 9999 that have distict digits?</p>
    <p> The first digit cannot be 0, so there are 9 choices: 1 through 9. The second digit can be anything from 0 to 9, except for whatever the first digit is, so there are 9 choices. Similarly, there are 8 choices for the third digit, and 7 for the last digit.</p>

    <p>Thus, there are <m>(9)(9)(8)(7)=4536</m> numbers with distinct digits.</p>

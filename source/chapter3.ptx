  <title>Logic with Quantifiers</title>
  <introduction>
   
    <p>
      We want to be able to expand our ability to use logic with mathematical statements. Many mathematical statements use variables. We say that an expression such as <m>x+y=5</m> is not a statement. However, if we can give more information about <m>x</m> and <m>y</m>, then we can use such an expression in a statement. For example, we could say there exists an <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> such that <m>x+y=5</m>. Or we could say for every <m>x</m> there exists a <m>y</m> with <m>x+y=5</m>. To use statements with <q>for every</q> and <q>there exists,</q> we will need to be able to understand logical statements with quantifiers.

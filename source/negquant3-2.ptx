  <title>Negating Quantified Statements</title><idx><h>quantifier</h><h>negation</h></idx>

  <p>In this section we will look at how to negate statements involving quantifiers.</p>

  <p>If you look back at the Check your Understanding questions in <xref ref="quantifiersI3-1"/>, you should notice that both <m>\forall x\in D, P(x)</m> and <m>\forall x\in D, \sim P(x)</m> were false, which means they are not negations of each other. Similarly, both <m>\exists x\in D, P(x)</m> and <m>\exists x \in D, \sim P(x)</m> were true. In general, the two statements won't necessarily have the same truth values, but the examples were chosen to make sure we can see that they are not negations of each other.</p>

  <title>Negating Quantified Statements</title><idx><h>quantifier</h><h>negation</h></idx>

  <p>The negation of <m>\forall x\in D, P(x)</m> is <m>\exists x\in D, \sim P(x)</m>.</p>
  <p>In notation: <me>\sim(\forall x\in D, P(x))\equiv \exists x\in D, \sim P(x).</me></p>
  <p>The negation of <m>\exists x\in D, P(x)</m> is <m>\forall x\in D, \sim P(x)</m>.</p>
  <p>In notation: <me>\sim(\exists x\in D, P(x))\equiv \forall x\in D, \sim P(x).</me></p>

</assemblage>

  <p>We can think of negation as switching the quantifier and negating <m>P(x)</m>, but it will be really helpful if we can understand <em>why</em> this is the negation. Thinking about negating a <q>for all</q> statement, we need the statement to not be true for all things, which means it must be false for something, Thus, there exists something making <m>\sim P(x)</m> true. Thinking about negating a <q>there exists</q> statement, we need there not to exist anything making <m>P(x)</m> true, which means <m>P(x)</m> must be false for everything. Thus, everything makes <m>\sim P(x)</m> true.</p>

  <example xml:id="E_negquant1"><title>Negating a Quantified Statement</title>
    <p>Negate the statement: For all primes <m>p</m>, <m>p</m> is odd. Is this statement true or false?</p>
    <answer><p>There exist a prime <m>p</m> such that <m>p</m> is not odd. The original statement is false, since we can find an even prime (<m>p=2</m>).</p></answer>

    <p>Negate the statement: There exists a real number <m>x</m>, such that <m>x^2&lt; 0</m>. Is this statement true or false?</p>
    <answer><p>For all real numbers <m>x</m>, <m>x^2\geq 0</m>. The original statement is false, since the negation is true.</p></answer>

  <p>Many of our quantified statements may have predicates involving other logical connectives. So it is going to be important to remember how to negate "and"s, "or"s, and "if...then"s. The following summarizes the rules we have already seen for negating statements with connectives</p>

<p>Recall from <xref ref="conditional2-2"/> the contapositive of <m>p\rightarrow q</m> is <m>\sim q\rightarrow p</m>. We can use this to define the contrapositive of a universal conditional statement.</p>

  <p>Similarly, the converse of <m>p\rightarrow q</m> is <m>q\rightarrow p</m>.</p>

  <p>The relationship between <q>for all</q> and <q>there exists</q> can be used to show some surprising things. What happens if our domain, <m>D</m>, has nothing in it? In particular, let <m>D=\emptyset</m>, the empty set. Is <m>\forall x\in D, P(x)</m> true or false? Well, let's look at the negation: <m>\exists x\in D, \sim P(x)</m>. Now the negation <em>must</em> be false since <m>D</m> has nothing in it, so there can't exist something in <m>D</m> making <m>\sim P(x)</m> true. Since the negation is false, the original statement is true! We say <m>\forall x\in D, P(x)</m> is <term>vacuously</term> true.<idx><h>statement</h><h>vacuously true</h></idx><idx>vacuously true</idx> </p>


  <example xml:id="E_vacuouslytrue"><title>Vacuously True Statement</title>
    <p>Consider the statement <q>For all llamas, <m>L</m>, in Discrete Math, <m>L</m> is getting an A.</q> The negation is <q>There exists a llama, <m>L</m>, in Discrete Math, such that  <m>L</m> is not getting an A.</q> Since no such llama exists, the negation is false. Making the original true. So every llama in Discrete is getting an A.</p>
  </example>

  <p>As one additional note, it can be helpful in deciding if your negation is correct by finding the truth value of both the original and the negation. They should have opposite values. Similarly, if you need to determine the truth value of a complex statement, it might be easier to find the truth value of the negation.</p>

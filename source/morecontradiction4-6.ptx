  <title>More Proof by Contradiction and Contrapositive</title>

  <p>In this section we will use contradiction and contrapositive to prove two classical theorems in mathematics.</p>

  <p>In <xref ref="A_n2evenneven" /> you used contrapositive to prove if <m>n^2</m> is even, then <m>n</m> is even. This statement is an important step in our first big theorem. We state it here formally as a lemma.</p>

<lemma xml:id="L_nsquaredeven"><statement>Let <m>n\in \mathbb{Z}</m>. If <m>n^2</m> is even, then <m>n</m> is even.</statement></lemma>
<proof><p>We will prove this by contrapositive. Assume <m>n</m> is odd. Show <m>n^2</m> is odd. Since <m>n</m> is odd, <m>n=2k+1</m> for some <m>k\in \mathbb{Z}</m>. Then 
<me>n^2=(2k+1)^2=4k^2+4k+1=2(2k^2+2k)+1.</me>
Since <m>2k^2+2k\in \mathbb{Z}</m>, <m>n^2</m> is odd.
</p>
</proof>

<theorem xml:id="T_roottwoirrational"><statement><p><m>\sqrt{2}</m> is irrational.</p></statement></theorem>

<proof><p>We will prove this by contradiction. Assume <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is rational. Then <m>\sqrt{2}=\frac{p}{q}</m> with <m>p, q\in\mathbb{Z}, q\neq 0</m>. We will additionally assume <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> have no common factors. [Note, this additional assumption just makes the proof simpler. You should convince yourself that it is reasonable to add this assumption--that given any fraction, we can always reduce so <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> have no common factors.]</p>
<p>Now, using algebra on the equations, 
  <md>
    <mrow>\sqrt{2}&amp;=\frac{p}{q}</mrow>
    <mrow>2&amp;=\frac{p^2}{q^2}</mrow>
    <mrow>2q^2&amp;=p^2.</mrow>
  </md>
  Since <m>q^2\in\mathbb{Z}</m>, <m>p^2</m> must be even. Then by <xref ref="L_nsquaredeven" />, <m>p</m> must be even.</p>
<p>Since <m>p</m> is even, <m>p=2k</m> for some <m>k\in \mathbb{Z}</m>. Thus, we can substitute into the above equation.
<md>
    <mrow>2q^2&amp;=(2k)^2</mrow>
    <mrow>2q^2&amp;=4k^2</mrow>
    <mrow>q^2&amp;=2k^2.</mrow>
  </md>
Since <m>k^2\in\mathbb{Z}</m>, <m>q^2</m> must be even. Then by <xref ref="L_nsquaredeven" />, <m>q</m> must be even.</p>

<p>But now we have <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> both even, which means they both have a common factor of 2. This contradicts our assumption that <m>p</m> and <m>q</m> have no common factors. Since we reached a contradiction, we can conclude that <m>\sqrt{2}</m> is irrational.</p>
</proof>

<p>Make sure you can read through the above proof and follow from one step to the next.</p>

<activity xml:id="A_squarediv3"><introduction><p>In <xref ref="L_nsquaredeven" /> and <xref ref="A_n2evenneven" />, we proved if <m>n^2</m> is even then <m>n</m> is even. Now suppose you want to prove if <m>n^2</m> is divisible by 3 then <m>n</m> is divisible by 3.</p></introduction>
<task><p>To prove the statement by contrapositive, what should you assume?</p></task>
<task><p>To prove the statement by contrapositive, what should you show?</p></task>
<task><statement><p>The problem with now giving a direct proof of the contrapositive, is that we need to know what we mean by <q><m>n</m> is not divisible by 3.</q> Recall the Quotient-Remainder Theorem, <xref ref="T_divisionalgorthm" />. If <m>n</m> is not divisible by 3, what are the possible forms for <m>n</m>?</p></statement><hint><p>Think of the forms for <m>n=3q+r</m>.</p></hint></task>
<task><p>Now write a proof by cases using the cases for <m>n</m> from (c) to show if <m>n</m> is not divisible by 3, then <m>n^2</m> is not divisible by 3.</p></task>

<p>Our second classical theorem is to prove there are infinitely many prime numbers. We previously proved there are infinitely many integers. In that proof, if we had a biggest integer, <m>N</m>, we were able to construct an integer that was greater than <m>N</m>, namely <m>N+1</m>. However, primes are not that nice. If you were to list out several prime numbers, it would be impossible to find a pattern for the <q>next</q> prime. Sometimes primes are close together, like 17 and 19, and sometimes they are far apart. In fact, it is possible to prove that we can find a list of <m>n</m> consecutive integers where none of the consecutive integers are prime for any positive integer <m>n</m>. This means there are arbitrarily long sequences of consecutive integers with no primes, or there are primes that are arbitrarily far apart.</p>

<p>First we need to understand a bit more about divisibilty with primes.</p>

<activity xml:id="A_divprimes"><introduction><p>Consider the statement: For all <m>a\in \mathbb{Z}</m> and primes <m>p</m>, if <m>p\mid a</m> then <m>p \nmid (a+1)</m>.</p></introduction>
<task><p>Write the contrapositive of the statement.</p></task>
<task><p>Write the negation of the statement.</p></task>
<task><p>Based on the contrapositive and the negation, which seem easier to use in a proof?</p></task>
<task><p>Assume <m>p\mid a</m> and <m>p \mid (a+1)</m>. Can you find a contradiction?</p></task>
<task><p>If you were able to find a contradiction, try to write a careful proof by contradiction for the statement.</p></task>

<p>The statement in <xref ref="A_divprimes"/> is an important lemma for proving there are infinitely many primes.</p>

<lemma xml:id="L_primedivplus1"><statement><p>For all <m>n\in\mathbb{Z}</m> and all primes <m>p</m>, if <m>p\mid n</m> then <m>p\nmid n+1</m>.</p></statement></lemma>
<proof><p>We will prove this by contradiction. Let <m>n\in\mathbb{Z}</m>, <m>p</m> prime. Assume <m>p\mid n</m> and <m>p\mid n+1</m>. Since <m>p\mid n</m>, <m>n=pk</m> for some <m>k\in \mathbb{Z}</m>. Since <m>p\mid n+1</m>, <m>n+1=pj</m> for some <m>j\in \mathbb{Z}</m>. Thus, 
<md>
    <mrow>n+1&amp;=pj</mrow>
    <mrow>pk+1&amp;=pj</mrow>
    <mrow>1&amp;=pj-pk=p(k-j).</mrow>
  </md>
Since <m>k-j\in\mathbb{Z}, p\mid 1</m>, and <m>p</m> is a factor of 1. However, the only factors of 1 are 1 and -1, which are not prime. Thus, we have a contradiction.
</p>
</proof>

<theorem xml:id="T_infmanyprimes"><statement><p>There are infinitely many primes.</p></statement></theorem>
  
<proof><p>Assume there are finitely many primes. Since there are finitely many, we can list them all, say, <m>p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n</m>. Now let <m>N=p_1\cdot p_2\cdot p_3\cdots p_n</m>, the product of all the primes. Consider <m>N+1</m>. We know <m>p_i\mid N</m> for each prime <m>p_i</m>. By <xref ref="L_primedivplus1"/>, <m>p_i\nmid N+1</m>. This means <m>N+1</m> is an integer greater than 1 with no prime divisor, which contradicts <xref ref="T_divbyprime" />.</p></proof>
